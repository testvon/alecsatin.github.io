message: 'Alec, if you could have known Dotty, who was the Teaching Director/Lecturer for 43 years at the Bible Study I attend.  She used to say, as she got into her eighties, "God, save a heart attack for me"   She died peacefully in her sleep at almost 91 years old.
  The "seal the deal" has always been helpful.
  Another saying was "go to the throne, not the phone" when we have problems....Its usually best to go to GOD, not a friend, though that has its times, too.  The poetry is beginning to sound like Jesse Jackson, but she was nothing like that!!!  Strong Conservative Christian woman who could talk the Bible to us every Thursday and make us yearning for more.
  It feels good to introduce you to her...she died last February.'
