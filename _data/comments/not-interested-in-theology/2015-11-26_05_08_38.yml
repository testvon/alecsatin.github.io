message: '"So our business is to preach the truth to them, trusting to the Holy Spirit to open their eyes and their understanding."  The biggest lesson Ive learned as a Christian - its not my job to open their eyes.  But I am responsible to make sure I dont throw down a stumbling block in their path.'
