message: 'The word, "theology" has always bothered me. Its a frigid word. Its capriciously uttered by many. Especially the unbelieving elite, to yet further distance themselves (and others) from Creator / Savior God who is only fully experienced by Divinely initially, granted, faith.
  
  "Studying" Creator God is the futile exercise of the finite mind. Experiencing Him, is life abundant, eternal.'
