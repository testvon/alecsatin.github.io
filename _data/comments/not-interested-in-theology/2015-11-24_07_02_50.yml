message: 'I see that at Community Bible Study so often....women who werent interested in faith at all, and suddenly something pulls them in and theyre hungrier and hungrier....I even know one member who was editing a New Age book that slammed the Scriptures so she joined to see what Scripture was about.  She thought shed stay, be convinced he was right, and leave.  Instead, shes become a strong believer and has been a member for about 25 years!  Her daughter also is a member now.  Thats only one example.   Beautiful stuff;  there is no explanation, no rationality for that, except that its the work of the Holy Spirit.'
