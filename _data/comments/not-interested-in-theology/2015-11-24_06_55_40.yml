  I have a link to a sight where you can listen to Lloyd-Jones called the MLJ Trust.  You can check it out and see if you want to have it available on your site, if you like.
  
  What Dr. Jones said about the Holy Spirit changing people to turn them to the truth is what God teaches us through Paul in Ephesians 5.
  
  But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleeps, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. Ephesians 5:13-14
  
  We need that work of the Holy Spirit for our blessing and Gods glory.  Amen!'
