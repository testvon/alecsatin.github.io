  My concern is the way free speech discussion is squelched.  Vishnap did quite a lot of research for this piece.  Some years back there were many more posts and sources available - all are now gone without explanation.
  
  Just imagine though if there really is an intentional superiority behind Apple.  The Golden Dawn people certainly had no love for the masses.  The freemasons are clearly hierarchical.  Other Illuminati type groups are not interested in the vast majority of people, except as slaves, animals and fodder.
  
  Think how many people are now using Apple products.  And the symbol on all of them exalts the serpent who supposedly brought intellectual and spiritual freedom to mankind.  What a lie from the pit - but how many people do you know who believe human beings are getting smarter and smarter?
  
  The truth is were getting dumber and dumber.  Were not evolving - were devolving from the perfection Adam and Eve had - and lost through original sin.
