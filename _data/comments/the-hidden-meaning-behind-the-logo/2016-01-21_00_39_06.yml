  The world was a much different place in those years not so very long ago.  Few could have foreseen how things have changed.  That should be a lesson to all of us - what seems so permanent now may be on the way out.   Our solid rock has got to be the Lord, with our dear families and loved ones not far behind.  All else is sinking sand.'
