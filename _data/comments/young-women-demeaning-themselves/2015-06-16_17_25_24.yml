message: 'I hear this a lot, too.  TERRIBLE language that, literally "would have made a sailor blush" (remember that expression?)...and in 17 yr old girls.
  There is nothing in their lives to keep them from demeaning themselves in this manner.  Thats the really sad thing.  And Shame is simply not allowed...no need for it because, today, "Anything Goes".
  I am a jazz singer and used to sing that old song...I got to thinking that "When Anything Goes, EVERYTHING goes."
  Did the girl not respond to you?
  She was probably busy sending naked selfies to a  boyfriend...or a guy shed just met. 
  SHOCKING....its AWFUL out there.'
