message: 'If there is one thing I hate the most, is being forced to hear some person repeatedly take the Lords Name in vain. Frivolously exclaiming His Name as if it were a curse word! Such utterance practice only showcases the sad and pathetic condition of the lost priceless soul. Also, it highlights the poor parental upbringing which apparently allowed this blasphemy speech to be embedded within the the offspring individual.
