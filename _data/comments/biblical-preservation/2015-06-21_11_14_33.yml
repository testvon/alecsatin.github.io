message: 'Bob - this is exactly the case with the newer NIV.  When they messed around with the genders the outcry was so great I understood they removed the Todays NIV from the market.  But, they waited a few years and quietly removed the 1984 NIV from the market, too.  You cant but it any more.  The new NIV (NNIV) is as bad or worse than the TNIV.  When does a translation become treyf (unclean)?
  
  Some say this is the inevitable result of a taught attitude that the Bible is just like any other ancient book.  Anyone who looks at the question with humility and reverence quickly understands that this is not the case, and treads lightly.  Such is the case of the best scholars through time.
  
  I wouldnt want to face God after having changed or removed His words.'
