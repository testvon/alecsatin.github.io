  I edited my previous comment to Bob to make it clearer from: “In most places, any Bible is perfectly fine except for the KJV.” to: In too many places, the KJV is not welcome.
  Its rare in the churches Ive visited to find anyone in the pulpit using the KJV - except for the independent fundamentalist churches, which are facing other difficulties these days.'
