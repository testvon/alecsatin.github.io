message: 'Im stunned at many Christian groups changing wording in the Bible..some Presbyterians are doing it now.  I hate to name denominations but that one stunned me.  A friends son is a pastor of a church of 1200;  he had to practically meet with each of  them and really explain the dangers of that ..so they all voted and opted to leave the Presbytery;  Now they have to leave the church compound and find a new one$$$ !!  Thankfully, its quite a wealthy church in N California.
  
  Comm. Bible Study, an international bible study, moved from NIV to ESV because of   changes made to the NIV that shouldnt be happening.  After 45 years with NIV.
  
  Heres the thing:  If we dont believe every word, whats the point?  Is it up to MAN to pick and choose, to change as it appeals to him?   Of course not.   The Bible is THE ONLY TEXT/THING that informs Christians..."I am a Christian, but dont really believe all thats in the Bible" simply mystifies.
  Thats MY story, and Im stickin to it :-)
  Great post, Alec.'
