message: 'What really got me about the NRSV is what they did to Ps. 34:8.  The KJV translates the second clause as "blessed is the man that trusteth in him."  The way it come out in the NRSV is: "happy are those who take refuge in him."  The problem?  The word translated by the KJV as "man" is the Hebrew word "gever," which has a distinctively masculine connotation.  ". . . this word specifically relates to a male at the height of his powers" (TWOT).  Hows that for PC editing?'
