message: 'Textual criticism can be a tricky issue.  I generally follow the Byzantine Text, on the grounds that it represents the consensus of the Eastern Church from about the 4th Century AD.  I am always leary of 19th German critics who try to second guess the Church fathers when they (the critics) have less manuscript evidence to go by.  However, having said that, I also compare the Byzantine Text with the Latin Vulgate (the "Textus Receptus" of the Western Church) and I also give weight to well attested Alexandrian readings, especially those in Codex Vaticanus.  Why?  In all likelihood Codex Vaticanus came from Athanasius himself, and was given either to the Western Roman Emperor or the Bishop of Rome.
  It should also be pointed out that the Textus Receptus (the basis for the KJV), is not a perfect representative of the Byzantine Text.'
