message: 'Hi Bob,
  Thanks for your comment.  "Textual criticism can be a tricky issue" - yes.  One things for sure - the amount of hatred for the Textus Receptus and King James Bible - and the people who hold to them - is remarkable.  In too many places, the KJV is not welcome.
  Keep fighting the good fight.
  Alec'
