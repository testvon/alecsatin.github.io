  That is not my experience.
  Most churches I have attended (and my "denomination") use the NIV, which I have little respect for except as a secondary source.
  Not only does the base text matter, but the philosophy (literal vs figurative) is important. I find the KJV literal.
  Figurative translations can be to easily swayed by doctrine, also.
  That a base text would rely on "more ancient" fragments which are now contradicted by an overwhelming Majority Text is troubling.
  Its not worth breaking fellowship over, but people need to know, and they dont.'
