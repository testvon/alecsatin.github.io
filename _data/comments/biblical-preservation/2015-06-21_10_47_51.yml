message: 'When it comes to translation philosophy, usually the choice is between the "formal equivalent" (word-for-word) and the "dynamic equivalent" (idea-for-idea).  Almost every translation will use a combination of the two, but some will lean in one direction and some in the other.  The KJV, NKJV and NASV are good examples of "formal equivalent" translations.  The NIV tends to be dynamic equivalent.  One translation I really dislike is the NRSV -- in an effort to gender neutral they would change singular pronouns to plural -- "he" becomes "they."  Thats just plain changing the meaning of the text because we dont like what the original said!'
