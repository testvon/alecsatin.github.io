  Hope others will take advantage of your recommendations. Perceiving how Kinseys work is bad science, and understanding how it has been used to forcibly change culture and marginalize healthy (Christian) attitudes towards sexuality makes grasping the shape of our cultural reality so much clearer.
  
  In regard to videos, if you use Firefox (or Chrome, but the Chrome browser has big privacy issues), a free browser extension called <a href="http://www.downloadhelper.net/" rel="nofollow">Video Download Helper</a> will let you save many items locally.  There are probably similar things available for Internet Explorer and Safari.
