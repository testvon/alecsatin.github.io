  Your use of the phrase "Dirty old man" and my agreement with the aptness of it betrays our betrayal of the new (yet very old) cultural ethos which makes our current time more and more like the days of Lot.  Nevertheless, let God and His morality be true and every man like Dr. John Money a liar.<br />

  How blessed we are to have been given eyes to see through the deception which is even now in the world.  These are wonderful days to be a Christian.  May you be given grace to shine forth even now.
  Amen.'
