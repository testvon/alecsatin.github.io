message: 'Grrrrr!!  We (as a culture) have been totally hoodwinked by this dirty old man.  Masters and Johnson did their part, too.  But this man was horrific.  And all the poisoned fruit of a poisoned tree -- the infamous Mary Calderone and SIECUS. You do a public service in continuing the publication of this as a fraud. Hes robbing children of their childhoods.
  
  One of his other frauds, Dr. John Money who is mentioned, led the charge for gender identity surgery, and he was the doctor involved in a tragic case of early childhood sex re-assignment documented in the book <i>As Nature Made Him:  the boy who was raised as a girl</i> by John Colapinto. The book is a terrific read, and shows you how experts can cow parents.
  
  I noted from this book that "Dr. John Moneys theories run counter to his own research for his doctoral thesis.  But they brought him a lot of research money and acclaim.  They brought his victims a lot of heartaches.  What the arrogant pride of one researcher has done to so many children and their families ought to be criminal.  Not to mention the gratuitous sexual posturing to which he subjected his young patients."  Another dirty old man.
  
  His work with little "Brenda" (nee Bruce) became a sensation feminists leapt on to support screwy theories of gender fluidity. You can see more <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/dr_money_prog_summary.shtml" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
