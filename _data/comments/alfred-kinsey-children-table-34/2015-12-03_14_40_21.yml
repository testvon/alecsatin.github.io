  You noted the exposure of Kinsey by Reisman.  There are two books by her on my shelf which I highly recommend to your readers:
  Kinsey: Crimes &amp; Consequences
  Kinsey, Sex and Fraud.
  
  The second book is co-nameed by Edward W. Eichel, with Dr. John H. Court and Dr. J Gordon Muir as editors.
  
  I also recommend the article, "How Alfred C. Kinseys Sex Studies Have Harmed Women and Children, by Robert H. Knight:
