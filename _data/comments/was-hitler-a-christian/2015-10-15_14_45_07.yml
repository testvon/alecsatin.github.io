  Thanks for the recommendation.  The book sounds worthwhile.  Heres the <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8379397-hitler-the-holocaust-and-the-bible" rel="nofollow">goodreads</a> description:
  
  <blockquote>
    In this updated edition, name Joseph Keysor addresses the growing trend among secularists to label Hitler as a Christian and therefore attribute the atrocities of the second world war to the Christian religion. Keysor does not settle for simply contrasting the Nazis behavior with the Biblical record. He also examines the true sources of Nazi ideology which are anything but Christian: Wagner, Chamberlain, Haeckel, and Nietzsche, to name a few. Keysor does not shy away from discussing Christian anti-semitism (alleged and real) throughout history and discusses Martin Luther, medieval anti-semitism, and the behavior of the Roman Catholic church and other Christian denominations during the Holocaust in Germany. Joseph Keysors well reasoned, well researched, and comprehensive defense of the Christian faith against modern accusations is a useful tool for scholars, pastors, and educators who are interested in the truth. "Hitler and Christianity" is a necessity in ones apologetics library, and secularists, skeptics, and atheists will be obliged to respond.
