message: 'There is an excellent book on the topic, which I found at an apologetics conference earlier this year.  "Hitler, the Holocaust, and the Bible," by Joseph Keysor.  It is very well documented, and proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Hitler was never a Christian, and that his ideology was that Christianity was to be destroyed.'
