  With regard to the last passage:  of what purpose is spreading the Gospel?
  
  Glenn and all,
  
  There is, it seems to me, a vast difference between "thinking" we can reform the world versus spreading the Gospel in the hope that we "might" reform the world.  It is a similar expectation to working to increase ones wealth.  We have dreams of the stars, but may only get as far as the moon, or even just the upper atmosphere.  The extent to which we succeed isnt important.  Its a destination/journey kinda thing.
  
  I dont believe Jesus encouraged them to spread the Gospel with no expectations.  I dont think he was thinking, "Go do this.  Nothing will come of it, but do it anyway."
  
  You guys are focusing on the results.  Im only dealing with the command and what it means when carried out.  Spreading the Gospel is an act of trying to reform the world.'
