  I find your statement "<i>its hard to love your enemy while you are killing them</i>" flippant. I pray you never have or never will be in a position to have to defend your loved ones from someone that you may be good friends with under different circumstances. I trained for 20 years to do just that, and yes, I did speak with my targets (on amateur radio) enjoying our conversations immensely and the pain and sadness that caused was only healed by Jesus. You need to take this quote to heart next time you feel the urge to flippancy
  
  <i>“The true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him, but because he loves what is behind him.” </i> - G.K. Chesterton
  
  I would love to see your biblical verse that says Christians are called to reform the world, because the bible tells us to set an example and to spread the Gospel. We are the light of the world, not the benign dictators.
  
  Mostly Im not sure where you get the misconception that all of God’s attributes can only be known out of a correct understanding of God’s love. It is true that He is love but the <i>only</i> attribute that is attributed to define God is <b>Holiness</b>. If you cant understand that, then theres no way you can understand anything about the myriad of His other attributes including love.
  
  When something is repeated in the bible its repeated so you will pay attention. The more its repeated the more important it is. When something is repeated three times, that is when God is shouting at us. 
  Revelation 4:8 - Holy Holy Holy is THE LORD GOD. 
  Isaiah 6:3 Holy, Holy, Holy, is the LORD of hosts.
  
  These repetitions of Holy Holy Holy is called the trihagion  expressing with force and passion the truth of the supreme holiness of God, that essential characteristic which expresses His awesome and majestic nature. God’s holiness is more than just His perfection or sinless purity; it is the essence of His “other-ness,” His transcendence. God’s holiness embodies the mystery of His awesomeness and causes us to gaze in wonder at Him as we begin to comprehend just a little of His majesty. Over and over in the bible it says He is Holy:
  
  1 Peter 1:16 YOU SHALL BE HOLY, FOR I AM HOLY.
  Psalm 22:3 You are holy,
  Isaiah 57:15 For thus says the high and exalted One Who lives forever, whose name is Holy
  Job 6:10 I have not denied the words of the Holy One
  Psalm 71:22 O Holy One of Israel.
  Isaiah 43:15 I am the LORD, your Holy One
  John 17:11 I come to You Holy Father
  1 Samuel 2:2 There is no one holy like the LORD
  Exodus 15:11 Who is like You, majestic in holiness
  Psalm 77:13 Your way, O God, is holy; What god is great like our God?
  Isaiah 40:25 To whom then will you liken Me That I would be his equal?" says the Holy One
  Revelation 15:4 You alone are holy
  1 Chronicles 16:35 To give thanks to Your holy name
  Psalm 33:21 Because we trust in His holy name
  Psalm 97:12 And give thanks to His holy name
  Luke 1:49 And holy is His name
  Isaiah 5:16 And the holy God will show Himself holy in righteousness
  Psalm 99:5 Exalt the LORD our God And worship at His footstool; Holy is He
  Leviticus 19:2 You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy
  
  In the bible "God is love" appears only twice, both times in 1 John, nowhere else in the bible. Why? Because His glorious attribute of Holiness far exceeds all other attributes including righteousness which is the most often repeated attribute but is never repeated three times.
  
  As I said before Josh, I dont think youre heretical or apostate, just confused. I truly do pray that you will fall under the tutelage of an elder that can untangle some of your conceptions'
