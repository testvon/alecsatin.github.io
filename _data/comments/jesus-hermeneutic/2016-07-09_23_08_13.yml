message: 'Well, when I say we are to reform individuals, I fully mean we are to preach the gospel, which itself will reform those who accept it.  In this way society may be reformed if enough Christians are living in it.  However, this will only happen in a minor way because non-Christians outnumber Christians exponentially, and always have.
  
  The world in the past at least had a fairly decent Judeo-Christian worldview, as can be seen in the various laws over the centuries, including laws about sexual morality.   But the culture has long since left that worldview overall and it is not recoverable and will only get worse.  SO, thinking that we can reform the world in any sense is silly.
  
  No, there is no "implicit" command to reform the world.  It is impossible to do so.'
