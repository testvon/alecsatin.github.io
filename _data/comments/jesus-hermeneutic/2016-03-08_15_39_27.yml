message: 'Great post!  Those wolves are the worst.  My standard reply to them:"Red letter Christians" tip their hands at their foundational error.  Jesus is God and is in agreement with all of scripture.  He quoted the Old Testament extensively, and referred to its most controversial elements without apology: Sodom &amp; Gomorrah, Adam and Eve, Noah, Jonah, etc.
  
  And Jesus didnt hand-write the Gospels.  They names had some eyewitness accounts and some reliable second-hand accounts, just like the epistles.  And all were inspired by God.
  
  The "red letter" Christians are nearly always false teachers who pretend that the only words of the Bible that really matter are direct quotes of Jesus (i.e., the words that are printed in red in some Bibles).  Their logic fails on many levels, and they cant even get their own pet verses right.
  
  If they were the least bit consistent theyd agree with Jesus "red letters" that say you should live on all the letters. Matthew 4:4 But he answered, “It is written, “ ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’ ”
  
  Got that, wolves?  The red letters say to live on all the letters.  Why dont you obey that simple teaching?
  
  The "red letters" crowd is full of nonsensical hypocrites.
  
  Black Letters Matter!'
