  <em>There but for the grace of God go I</em>.  The deception around us is almost strong enough to deceive the very elect.  Its terrifying to me to see it.  Im comforted only by Gods promise:
  
  <em>And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. 
  My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no manis able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand.  (John 10:28-29)</em>
  
  Praise be to him.
  
  Alec'
