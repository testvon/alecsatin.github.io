  Black Letters Matter!  Quite :)
  
  Your use of Matthew 4.4 neatly and precisely cuts through what youve called correctly their "failing logic".  Have you ever asked a "red letter" person to comment on it?  I can imagine them throwing it out with their blanket denial that, "only Jesus words actually proceed out of the mouth of God" or something of that sort.
  
  Yet, Jesus did say this as well as confirming the historicity  and truth of Sodom &amp; Gomorrah, Adam and Eve, Noah, Jonah, etc. as youve said.
  
  Going over these things may not convince any of them, but it sure is helpful to me and those of us who are left speechless at the boldness of these wrongheaded who nonetheless claim the name of Christ.
  
  Always appreciate your insights.  Thank you.
  
  Alec'
