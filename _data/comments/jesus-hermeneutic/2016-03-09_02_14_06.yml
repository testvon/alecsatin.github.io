message: 'People today who feel that Christians are obligated to go out and take over the world for Christ and build a "Christianized" society may be sincere and oh so politically correct, but they need to be reminded of one thing: the next kingdom on the horizon is the kingdom of the Antichrist...not the kingdom of Christ. Go read the book of Daniel.
  
  Our job is to tell people that Christ died to save lost sinners, not to reform a liberal society.
  
  Oh, and these Red Letter folks would do well to direct their attention to 2 Timothy 3:16 that says:
  
  "&lt;<em>ALL!!!</em>&gt; scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness."
  
  Emphasis added.'
