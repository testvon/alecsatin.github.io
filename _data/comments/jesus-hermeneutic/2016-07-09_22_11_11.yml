message: 'I dont dispute any of what either of you are saying.  I merely speak to the assertion that theres nothing in Scripture that suggests we reform the world.  For that matter, I dont believe it actually says anything about reforming a single person.  It tells us to spread the Gospel.  My point is telling us to spread the Gospel is an implicit command to reform the world for acceptance of the Gospel will do just that.  Whether every accepts the Gospel or not is another thing, as were taught not everyone will.  So this, too, is not in dispute.  Only what the Bible teaches with regard to reforming anyone or everyone is where I differ, because Im thinking in terms of what spreading the Gospel is likely to accomplish should everyone who hears it come to the Lord.  It will reform the world, and therefore, the encouragement to spread the Gospel is one of reforming the world.  Said another way, the command to spread the Gospel is an expectation of the result of doing so, which is a reformation.'
