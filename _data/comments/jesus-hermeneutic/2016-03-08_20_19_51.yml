message: 'Hi Doug,
  
  Learned a lot from what youve said.  Thank you.
  
  Ive never cracked open "The Message" or any of the loosey-goosey (dynamic) translations.  It scares me that translators have so little fear of God that they would play fast and loose with his words.  Just because this has been going on since 1870 or so doesnt mean it is any less horrifying to watch.
  
  This is a brilliant insight youve made:
  
  <em>Of course sodomy, apostasy, and child sacrifice are not mentioned as evils in the social gospel, those are the sacraments of the social gospel.</em>
  
  Sacraments.  How terrible, yet quite right.  Just what the enemy might be expected to place at the heart of his imitation faith.
  
  And this is quite something:
  
  <em>, Gandhi said “I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians.” </em>
  
  Thank you for your firm stance.  Its a comfort.
  
  Alec'
