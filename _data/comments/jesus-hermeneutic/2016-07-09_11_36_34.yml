message: 'Hi Art,
  So appreciate your weighing in on this topic.  As youd probably agree, definitions are key.  It seems that there are two broad ways that "reform the world" is understood.
  
  <strong>Definition A - held by some evangelicals and many Emergents:</strong>
  
  "Reform the world" means to use the government, business, media, and other forms of marketing and public relations (<a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-PropgndndPblcRltnsGvrnmnt.html" rel="nofollow">literally propaganda</a>) to change society for "the better".  Partnerships (unionism) with people of other branches of Christianity and even other religious or non-religious streams are perfectly fine when done for the purpose of "advancing Christs kingdom".
  
  <strong>Definition B</strong>
  
  Human beings and all human societies are corrupted by original sin.  The only real "reforming of the world" takes place one person at a time through the means of grace - the Holy Spirit working through the Word of God.  Proclaiming the gospel of salvation from sin through faith in the all-sufficient one-time sacrifice of Jesus Christ <em>always changes the world through the irresistable power of God</em>.  Those who hear and believe through faith become sons and daughters of God.  Those who refuse to hear and believe are hardened even more.  God is sovereign.  He raises us governments and rulers, corporate and megachurch leaders, and brings them down according to his purposes (Daniel 2.21, Romans 13.1). Ultimately this world will be destroyed by fire for the wicked unbelief of its people.
  
  <strong>To your points</strong>
  
  Jesus said clearly that his kingdom was not of this world (John 18.36).  Even with the best of intentions, joining with people who reject Gods Word will not result in reforming the world for the better (2 Cor 6.14).
  
  Art said: <em>Hereâ€™s the problem, however: logically, should everyone set an example and spread the Gospel, and should all who see that example, hear that Gospel then be changed, has the world not been reformed?</em>
  
  First, everyone who hears the gospel preached or spoken, <em><strong>is changed</strong></em>. This is the power of Gods Word.  A person either believes it - feeding their faith - or disbelieves it - feeding their unbelief.  <strong>Gods word is always efficacious</strong>.  No matter whether we see change or not, it is taking place at the deepest levels of every person, every time (Isaiah 55.11).
  
  Next, every true Christian is already an example, a living stone in the New Jerusalem, a temple of the Living God.  In time, Christians do tend to spread the gospel in one way or another in obedience to the command of Christ.
  
  So a persons definition of "reform the world" will shape the Biblical answer.  At least thats how I see it.  Perhaps others will weigh in with other perspectives.'
