message: 'The straw-man I see a lot of people arguing against (at least in my case), is that I dont believe the "Black letters matter". Let me set the record straight. I do. I also agree that sodomy, abortion (this is not child sacrifice), and religious apostasy (apparently I am guilty of this) are wrong.  Maybe that doesnt make me a "Red letter Christian" in the sense you mean in this post.
  
  The death penalty does cause me to pause, but I believe that Governments are free to do what best keeps their people safe and free. This is by no means Christian though.
  
  Jesus was pretty radical to the Jews of his time. He changed a lot of their practices. He didnt contradict the Bible, but he did call the Pharisees to re-examine their faith. He also upset the power system they were a part of.
  
  I believe that God wants to use Christians to reach the world.(See Great Commission) So yeah I guess I believe, Christians are called to reform the world.
  
  I would not say that non-violence is the supreme morality, but I do believe that it is hard to love your enemy while you are killing them.
  
  All of Gods attributes can only be known out of a correct understanding of Gods love. God IS Love. This is the only attribute that is attributed to define God.  God is just, but we can only understand Gods justice as an aspect of his Love. 
  If youâ€™re not feeding the poor, clothing the homeless, etc, you are no real Christian.
  
  Finally, serving the poor, orphan, and widow does not make you a Christian. Christ empowers us to serve these people, and it is a part of true Christian charity.
  
  Isnt it possible to value the moral truths against sodomy, abortion, and apostasy while also opposing violence in the name of Christ, emphasizing the service of the least of these,  and seeing God as love? After all the black letters state that God is love too... 1 John 4:8'
