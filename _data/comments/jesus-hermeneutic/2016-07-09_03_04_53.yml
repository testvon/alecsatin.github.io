message: 'Still going through some posts of yours.  This wasnt one on which I had intended to leave a comment, but one thing stood out with which I find a conflict.  Ill copy and paste an example here:
  
  <i>"I would love to see your biblical verse that says Christians are called to reform the world, because the bible tells us to set an example and to spread the Gospel."</i>
  
  The above appeared in a comment from Doug Evans, and it has been echoed by others many times.  Heres the problem, however:  logically, should everyone set an example and spread the Gospel, and should all who see that example, hear that Gospel then be changed, has the world not been reformed?  Particularly if those who have been changed also go forth setting good examples and spreading the Gospel?  I would think so.  Thus, the Bible does indeed tell us to reform the world by encouraging the spreading of the Gospel.  I dont think that encouragement is given with no expectation that at least some will be properly affected.  Do you?'
