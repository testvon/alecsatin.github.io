message: 'So much to reply to.  But Ill just hit one.  GOD instituted Capital Punishment for murder when Noah stepped off the boat.   That law was for all people for all time.  IF you think executing murderers is wrong, take it up with God.
  
  Oh, and how much can I love my neighbor if I stand by and watch her assaulted and raped when I have a gun and could blow the guy away before the assault goes to far.  Evil is people who demand 100% non-violence, regardless of what God has said.'
