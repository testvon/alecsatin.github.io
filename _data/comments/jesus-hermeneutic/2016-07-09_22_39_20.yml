message: 'Do any of us (Art, Doug, Glenn) believe that we can reform individuals or society?  It seems like were in agreement that God saves those who believe the gospel.  Hes doing the reforming, not us.  We are only the messengers.
  
  Were also agreeing that we are commanded to spread the good news.
  
  The question seems to be if Art is right when he says:
  <strong><em>telling us to spread the Gospel is an implicit command to reform the world</em></strong>
  
  I would offer three possible cases where the gospel was delivered but the societies were not reformed.  This makes it hard for me to see an implicit (or explicit) command to reform the world in the NT Scriptures.
  
  <ol>
  <li>Noah, building the ark for 55 or more years before the flood in obedience to the Word of God, yet only 7 people other than Noah went on the ark with him out of all the other people who witnessed what he was doing.  That society was not reformed.</li>
  
  <li>Lot, living in the midst of Sodom, recognized as "other" and saved by Gods direct intervention.  That society was not reformed either.</li>
  
  <li>Jerusalem after the resurrection.  Many Jewish people believed, but the society was destroyed in 70 ad.</li>
  </ol>
  
  As quoted earlier, Jesus himself denied that the Kingdom of God is of this world:
  
  <em> Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.  </em>(John 18:36)
  
  and even more strongly in Acts:
  
  <em>When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? (7) And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.  (8) But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. </em> (Acts 1:6-8)
  
  They asked if Jesus was going to change the political order.  Jesus said it was not their business.  Instead, they should just preach the gospel.
  
  Or am I misreading these things?'
