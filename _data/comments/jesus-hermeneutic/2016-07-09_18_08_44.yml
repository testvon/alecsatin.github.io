  Im going to suggest that you are taking Dougs comment out of context.
  
  When he pointed out that we are not here to reform the world, the context, as I have understood him because I say the same thing, is that we are not called to promote a social gospel, we are not called to "Christianize" the world as with the NARs ideology.  We are not called to make everyones morality conform to our morality.  We are not called to reform the world into a Christian culture.
  
  All that is what the false teachers promote.  But we are called to preach the gospel and for those who accept it, it will be THEM individually who will be reformed.  So we care called to reform individuals, not the world.  The world could be reformed as a whole only if the majority of the world were reformed as individuals.'
