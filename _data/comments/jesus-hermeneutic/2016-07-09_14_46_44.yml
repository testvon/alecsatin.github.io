message: 'Yes, youre right, <i>everyone</i> should set an example and spread the Gospel, but youre a bit off base when you said
  
  <i>...should everyone set an example and spread the Gospel, and should all who see that example, hear that Gospel then be changed...</i>
  
  The problem with your statement is that you are assuming that everyone that hears the Gospel will be changed. This, sadly, is totally, biblically false. Only those that embrace the Holy Spirit will be changed, everyone else will reject the Good News
  
  <i>12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God, 13 which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words.
  14 But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised.</i> 1 Corinthians 2:12-14
  
  In other words, we understand the Gospel not because of anything in this sin filled world, but with the tutelage of the Holy Spirit. To those who are not guided by the Holy Spirit the Gospel is utter nonsense. And sadly thats going to be the majority of the population, how do we know?
  
  <i>"For many are called, but few are chosen."</i> (Matthew 22:14)
  
  This rejection of God and His word and the embracing of sin is called the "noetic effect of the fall" which I wrote about here:

  So, we know that the majority of the people we share the Gospel with are not going to be changed, many are going to be hostile to the Gospel, we are strangers in a strange world and the world hates us because we love Jesus. We have surrendered ourselves to God, while the world has surrendered itself to sin. But a few, a precious few, will listen and let the Holy Spirit convict them of Christs love. Those are the few we are looking for. Were not here to reform the world, were here to spread the Gospel and open a few doors for the Holy Spirit. God will reform the world in His own time, and its going to be spectacular.'
