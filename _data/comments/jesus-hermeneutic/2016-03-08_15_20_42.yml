  We met some of these types during the 12 years we had a street ministry in Iowa City.  Most of these types were college students who had already been fed staunch liberalism from their professors, and the "red letter" teaching just supported their accepted (brainwashed) world view.  These people are really difficult to reach with the truth.'
