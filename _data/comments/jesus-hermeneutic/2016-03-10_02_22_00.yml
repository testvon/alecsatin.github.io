message: 'Hi Josh,
  
  Perhaps you really are not a "Red Letter Christian".  Good!  Then you are just unclear in some of the things you have said.  You also seem to ignore the "Scripture interprets Scripture" rule.  Therefore your conception of God and his attributes differs from mine.  We will not be able to come to an agreement.
  
  Abortion is child sacrifice.  It is getting rid of inconvenient births for the economic benefit or the convenience of the parents.  But you have stated your disagreement with this.  Let it go at that.
  
  As I said before, it matters little what I or anyone else thinks of your relationship to God.  If you do not believe you are apostate, then you shouldnt be concerned with what I or anyone else thinks.  But, if you or anyone else states publicly in a comment or elsewhere things which go contrary to an orthodox understanding of theology or doctrine, then it is perfectly correct to call out the error.
  
  Finally, sodomy, abortion and apostasy have nothing to do with your arguments against violence.  The first three are explicitly condemned throughout the Bible.  But this particular subject is concluded.
  
  You keep repeating certain statements that you have written in comments here and on other blogs.  If they come up again, I will be forced to edit them in accordance to the new commenting rules.  Please read them.
  
  Alec'
