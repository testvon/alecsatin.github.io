message: 'You are probably right, my comment was more flippant than it should have been. I apologize if this offended you or anyone else. It was not a personal attack on anyone that has made the protection of others their lifes work.  I understand the sincere quote by Chesterton too, but I still see it as misguided.  Can the military do the work of God? Sure. Is there anything Christian about the military? I dont think so. It is a function of government, and governments can be good and bad. In fact every government is good and bad to differing degrees.  In America, in my opinion, we have typically been more good than bad, but we have done some atrocious things too. Countries are never the Kingdom of God, and thus we cant pledge allegiance to both.
  
  God is Love may only be exactly stated twice, but the passages about Gods love are far more numerous than two. Like the point I made about justice, Holiness must be understood as looking like Gods love. Not only that, Gods Love must also reflect his holiness. Gods love is mysterious and "other", compared to our love. Gods love can be understood in relationship to his holiness.'
