  "In the volume of the book it is written of me"
  "...and beginning with Moses and all the prophets..." on the Emmaus Road
  Isaiah 53 explained by Philip to the Ethiopian eunuch
  Psalm 22
  Genesis 3:16
  
  And so, so much more.  The entire Bible is about Jesus and His gospel.  Thats what people need to know.'
