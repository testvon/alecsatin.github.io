  Thats exactly what Im saying. We are here to <i>help</i> save those capable of being saved, to point them in the right direction. Maybe Martial Art means that by reforming the world we love and aid everyone, including those that reject the word of God, which is the exact right thing to do.
  
  However I can find no biblical reference that we are to Reform the world as the NAR dominionists describe. The "Christian" Left actually has the right idea at their core, but theyve allowed their political ideology to become an idol and in the end are merely re-arranging deck chairs on the Titanic.
  
  As I see it, our job is to set an example and open up the opportunity of Salvation for everyone until the last person who can be saved is saved. Thats when God takes complete control and does it His way. The idea that we are to Reform the world, to convert everyone, is biblically impossible. Thats what the Book of Revelations says loud and clear.
