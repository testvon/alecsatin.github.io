message: 'Excellent post! wow. I could probably do an entire series of posts based on a proper response to your work here. Allow me to hit a few points that popped to mind;
  
  Tony Compolo, Brian McLaren, Jim Wallace, of course theyre wild about the Emergent Church - they built it using the horrible The Message perVersion of the bible as their main tool. Watch "Wide Is The Gate" volume 1 to get a good perspective on the post modern nightmare thats attempting to take over the church. And to get a good perspective on The Message just read Psalm 1 in a real bible and compare it side by side with The Mess...age.
  
  Of course sodomy, apostasy, and child sacrifice are not mentioned as evils in the social gospel, those are the sacraments of the social gospel.
  
  Using any quote from from any pagan, including Gandhi, is an utterly ridiculous way to base a "Christian" theology. Whats wrong with quoting God? And dont forget, Gandhi said â€œI like your Christ, I do not like your Christians." How would you like it if someone told you "I like you, but your wife is a hag" Would you base anything in your life on what that man just said?
  
  Personally I feel sorry for Red Letter "Christians", they follow Christ because theyre told to, and for no other reason. Without ALL the letters they have no idea of why Christ came to us, they know nothing of the fall, of the suffering, of the promises made, they know nothing of the prophesies fulfilled by Jesus Christ. My personal guess as to why so many member of the "Christian" left are anti-semitic is because theyve never prayerfully read Ephesians (and lets face it, if they actually read Romans 1 would they hold the same views they now have?)
  
  Poor Josh, I maintain my opinion of him: hes confused. I feel sorry for him; Being a Red Letter "Christian" he will never know the joy and wonder of identifying a Christophany, by turning his back on the God breath explanative epistles he will never know the depth of love God has for us. How can Josh love someone he refuses to learn about?
  
  As for dealing with Red Letter "Christians", I wrote about it here:

  I even made a pretty picture:
