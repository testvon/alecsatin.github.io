  Actually, Im making no assumption at all.  Im merely responding to the assertion that theres no Biblical support for the notion of trying to reform the world.  That encouragement exists without regard to the success of it.  But we are instruments of God if we are truly trying to live a Christian life.  By purposely trying to spread the Gospel, we can be the means by which God calls others to Him, and that leads to reform to any extent that reformation of the world might happen.  That were also taught that many will reject God, <i>that</i> teaching is irrelevant to our response regarding the encouragement to spread the Gospel.'
