message: 'The only social media I use is Blogger and Twitter. Ive already met some of my Blogger "buddies". I can usually tell after a few conversations if theyre worth knowing or not. It helps that Im a motorcyclist and most of my "followers" also ride. Not to brag, but theres something special about motorcyclists. Also, my husband is on the Honda CB 1100 forum. We had a big meet and greet in western NC last May and plan to do another this year. Some of the Australian members even showed up! That was a hoot. We had such a wonderful time. I highly recommend putting a face to the social media folks when possible. Have you had the opportunity to meet any of your "followers" Alec? Id like to hear about your experience(s) too. Have a blessed day. ~:)'
