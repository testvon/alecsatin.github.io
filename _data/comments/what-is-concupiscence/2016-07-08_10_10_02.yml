message: 'Hi Ducky,
  
  Thank you for bringing up this subject.   Its been really helpful to dig into where the Roman Catholic sacrament of penance agrees and differs from what the Scriptures teach.
  
  Were substantially in agreement with the main point, concupiscence.  As you say, "You may be born again but you have not abolished the frailty and weakness of our nature and I think we agree that struggle never ends."  This is an excellent definition. For Christians the struggle against sin will only end once this earthly life is over and those who are born again are given new bodies like Christs (1 Cor 15; 1 John 3.2).
  
  You and I also agree that Biblical confession confers grace.  Most non-Lutheran Protestants reject the idea of means of grace due to understandable discomfort with anything that smacks of Roman Catholic sacramentalism.  Sacramentalism is "the doctrine that sacraments are inherently efficacious and indispensable to salvation and capable of conferring grace on a recipients soul" (Websters Third Unabridged).
  
  The road between the Bible and the Roman Catholic doctrine of confession diverges at four key points: (a) Roman Catholic confession is mandatory, (b) it must be before a priest, (c) all sins must be enumerated, and (d) works of satisfaction are given to perform (e.g. say 3 "Hail Marys").
  
  The references to Roman Catholic dogma are from the <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church, Second Edition</em> <a href="http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc.htm" rel="nofollow">source</a>
  
  <strong><em>(a) Roman Catholic confession is mandatory</em></strong>
  
  <em>According to the Churchs command, "after having attained the age of discretion, each of the faithful is bound by an obligation faithfully to confess serious sins at least once a year."</em> <a href="http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a4.htm#1457" rel="nofollow">1457</a>
  
  <strong><em>(b) Confession must be before a Roman Catholic priest</em></strong>
  
  <em>"Since ancient times the bishop, visible head of a particular Church, has thus rightfully been considered to be the one who principally has the power and ministry of reconciliation: he is the moderator of the penitential discipline. Priests, his collaborators, exercise it to the extent that they have received the commission either from their bishop (or religious superior) or the Pope, according to the law of the Church. </em><a href="http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a4.htm#1462" rel="nofollow">1462</a>
  
  But the New Testament says that all believers are priests.
  
  <em>Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</em> (1 Peter 2:5)
  
  <em>And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</em> (Revelation 1:6)
  
  It also tells us that we can confess to any other Christian:
  
  <em>Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</em> (James 5:16)
  
  <strong><em>(c) The Roman Catholic church requires all sins be enumerated</em></strong>
  
  <em>"All mortal sins of which penitents after a diligent self-examination are conscious must be recounted by them in confession,</em> <a href="http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a4.htm#1456" rel="nofollow">1456</a>
  
  But the Bible says that all sins the believer commits are forgiven at the moment of salvation, when he or she is justified by faith in Christ alone:
  
  <em>And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses; Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; (Colossians 2:13-14)
  
  <strong><em>(d) The Roman Catholic penitent is given works of satisfaction to perform (e.g. say 3 "Hail Marys")</em></strong>
  
  </em><em>The penance the confessor imposes must take into account the penitents personal situation and must seek his spiritual good. It must correspond as far as possible with the gravity and nature of the sins committed. It can consist of prayer, an offering, works of mercy, service of neighbor, voluntary self-denial, sacrifices, and above all the patient acceptance of the cross we must bear.</em>  <a href="http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a4.htm#1460" rel="nofollow">1460</a>
  
  But the Bible says that Christ alone covers our sins, not any works that we do.  <em>If we confess our sins, he [Jesus Christ] is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. (1 John 1:9)</em>'
