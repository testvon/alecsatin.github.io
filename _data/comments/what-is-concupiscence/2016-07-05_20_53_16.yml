  Excellent question.
  
  Perhaps someone who is more knowledgeable about Roman Catholicism will answer your question in more detail about that system.  A simple answer would say that the RCC clearly rejects the Biblical teaching of Justification by faith alone.  At the Council of Trent the Roman Catholic Church stated that works like the "Catholic sacrament of confession" you refer to are necessary for salvation.  If you dont confess early and often to a Roman Catholic priest, you are on your way to purgatory.   This is a teaching with no Biblical support.
  
  When a person becomes born again by believing on Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, he becomes a new creature.  Old things are passed away.  All things become new.  How many sins were forgiven at the moment the person became saved?  Every single one the person would ever commit.
  
  We ask forgiveness because we are troubled at the hurt we do to God and ourselves by our sin.  Our confession is to God directly - no intermediary is required by the believer.  Having said that, if a person wants to confess to another human being, he or she can do so to any other Christian and receive assurance that they are forgiven.
  
  Does this help, Ducky?
  
  <strong>Council of Trent</strong>
  <em>CANON 12:  "If any one shall say that justifying faith is nothing else than confidence in the divine mercy pardoning sins for Christs sake, or that it is that confidence alone by which we are justified . . . let him be accursed"</em>
  
  <em>Canon 14: "If any one saith, that man is truly absolved from his sins and justified, because that he assuredly believed himself absolved and justified; or, that no one is truly justified but he who believes himself justified; and that, by this faith alone, absolution and justification are effected; let him be anathema (condemned to hell)."</em>
  
  <em>Canon 30:  "If any one saith, that, after the grace of Justification has been received, to every penitent sinner the guilt is remitted, and the debt of eternal punishment is blotted out in such wise, that there remains not any debt of temporal punishment to be discharged either in this world, or in the next in Purgatory, before the entrance to the kingdom of heaven can be opened (to him); let him be anathema (condemned to hell)."</em>'
