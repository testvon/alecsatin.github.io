  As far as our sins....yes, all sin was forgiven upon being saved but we must continue to be repentant, dont you believe?  Not through standard Hail Marys, etc., but through desperate, loving prayer.
  I must add here, however, that while I dont worship Mary, I do think a lot of the woman GOD CHOSE TO BEAR HIMSELF!  I mean, really...quite a woman!
  
  ODD that this would come up today because just this morning I was thinking of a forty yr old friend who considers me her Christian mentor and who has lived with her boyfriend for 7 years now.  VERY touchy subject for me; She knows the truth, absolutely, definitely.  From me and her very strong Christian brother and sis-in-law.
  
  She knows how I feel about it.  And my grace to her is to trust that, because she knows the truth, grace is bestowed on ME and her, for leading her as I can and keeping my big trap shut since the first time I mentioned it to her.  She stays close to me even when I do rarely infer my frustrations so something is going right.  Thats important to me and to her, that she stays close.  And I praise God for His trust in me.  And in her.
  Its a very tough one for me, I have to admit. VERY tough.'
