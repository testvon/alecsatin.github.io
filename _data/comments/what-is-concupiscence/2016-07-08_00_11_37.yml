  You may be born again but you have not abolished the frailty and weakness of our nature and I think we agree that struggle never ends.
  As a result Catholics are encouraged to make frequent acts of contrition (i.e. prayers confessing sin) but the sacrament(technically the Sacrament of Reconciliation), by its very nature, confers graces that help us to live a Christian life. 
   The sacraments are an outward sign of an inward grace. In this case, the outward sign is the absolution of sins that the priest grants to the penitent; the inward grace is the reconciliation of the penitent to God.'
