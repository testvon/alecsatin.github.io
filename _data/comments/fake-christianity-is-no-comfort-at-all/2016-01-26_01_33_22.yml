message: 'As my mother was dying a hospice chaplain asked if she could help me.  I doubt she expected my manner or answer which I tried to make gracious (for her kindness) yet affirmatively that of a CHristian assured of her destination. As another strong Christian friend asked, "how do people do this without Christ?" The a better place platitude falls way short.'
