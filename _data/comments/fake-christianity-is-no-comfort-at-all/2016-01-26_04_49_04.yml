message: 'The Bible tells us plainly that evil will increase as we approach the end of this age. Satan will actually be given greater license to work his evil in order to test the hearts of men. The deceptions that will be believable will resemble the truth very closely. The counterfeits that the god of this world has reserved for the times at the end will be as close as possible to the real thing yet without substance and life.'
