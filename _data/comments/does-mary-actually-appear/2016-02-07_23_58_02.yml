message: 'Excellent video.  Yes, the apparitions are demonic vs being "Mary."
  
  I picked up a copy of "Quite Contrary" ten years ago, and it is really an excellent examination of the apparitions.
  
  I also highly recommend "The Cult of the Virgin: Catholic Mariology and the Apparitions of Mary," by Elliot Miller and Kenneth R. Samples.  Its from about the same time period as the other book, but I found this one in 1995.'
