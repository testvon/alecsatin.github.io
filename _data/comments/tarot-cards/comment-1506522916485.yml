message: "Dear Roselyn\r\n\r\nThe most important thing to remember is, \"Perfect love casts out all fear\" (1 John 4:18). Trust in Christ.  Ask Him to forgive you and to protect you.  We know that He will do so.  How?  Because he tells us. \"He who comes to me I will by no means cast out\" (John 6:37).  Draw closer to Him by reading His Word and He will draw closer to you.  The Holy Spirit is always present when the Bible is read, discussed, or preached.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow about your family member, the best thing you can do is to love her and to pray that God gives her a love of the truth.  It may or may not be up to you to talk to her about what she's doing.  But you yourself should know that she is doing something that is very deceptive and harmful to her over the long run.  God hates it.  There is no uncertainty about this.  \r\n\r\nMay God give you peace and wisdom.  \r\n\r\nAlec"
