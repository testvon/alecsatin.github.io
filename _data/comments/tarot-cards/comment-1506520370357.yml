  Thank you Alec for your thoughts.  I am a Christian and have recently had 2
  Tarot readings done by a member of my family that I love and respect. She is
  very skilled in Tarot reading and my readings were very accurate.  My last
  reading was actually exciting.  I didn't ask any questions, she just read my
  cards.  After reading your article I will never again have another, and now
  I'm actually afraid.  Was it a type of evil spirit working through her?  She
  also claims to talk to dead people but says it is all for good.  I am now
  worried about her.  She is such a wonderful person!  What are your thoughts?
