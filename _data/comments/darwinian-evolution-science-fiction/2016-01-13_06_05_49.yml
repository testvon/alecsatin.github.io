message: 'In Darwins time they thought of cells as kind of blobs.  Its almost like Gods like joke - letting foolish men spin elaborate tales ("friction with the truth" - I love that!) about BIG cosmology, then opening the door to microbiology.  Nothing is more convincing to me than how the eyes works and, getting smaller, how the cell works.  My gosh!  Darwins little blob is an intricate city of energy, industry, manufacturing, storage, waste management and guardianship at the door that operates with amazing balance and precision.  Oops.'
