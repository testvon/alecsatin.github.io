  Few people know that they license their books for their Kindle.  If Kindles licensing arrangement with that publisher ends you will find it wiped from your device, too. I believe its still the same with iTunes.  People with large collections are shocked to find they cant will them to their heirs because the license isnt transferrable. Ive run into this trying to buy an audiobook I saw on my providers website when I viewed it from a computer that didnt know my location was in the US.  I couldnt find it at home to order it.  Another licensing issue: available in the UK, but not the US.
  
  In a similar vein, its worth reading about Michael Yons "Encounter with Eurocracy, and Why Digital Cameras Have a 30 Minute Video Recording Limit." <a href="http://www.michaelyon-online.com/my-encounter-with-eurocracy-and-why-digital-cameras-have-a-30-minute-video-recording-limit.htm" rel="nofollow">Here. </a>
  
  Once guys who think they are smart and should be in charge actually GET in charge you get nanny state stuff like this, and other EU gems such as limiting the amount of cinnamon you can put on your Danish pastry.
  
  Privacy and freedom are not values to the left who uses them more as shields to cover their own tracks.  Here in California our [extremist, left] attorney general has decided that our laws on disclosure from charities have never been interpreted correctly until SHE interpreted them to require disclosing donor lists.  She, of course, made up this rule to drive funding away from conservative causes whose donors have been aggressively targeted in recent years in the state.  For example, donors as small at $100 to a popular marriage initiative were targeted, hounded and many gotten fired for their support of traditional marriage.  There is a frightening assault on many fronts to stiffle, control, and eradicate all unacceptable thought.'
