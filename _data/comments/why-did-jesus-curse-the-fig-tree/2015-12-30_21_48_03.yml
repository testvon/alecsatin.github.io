message: 'There was a time when I found Jesus curse of the fig tree surprising.  But once I understood <b>its not bearing fruit</b> there is no more surprise.  As the fig tree the nation Israel was established to do just that. They failed.  We see Gods symbolic response of judgment in Jesus curse of the fig tree. Two verses later hes driving the moneychangers out of the temple.
  
  Now the church is charged with bearing fruit in the world.  As you asked, how are we doing?
  
  <i>I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned.</i><i> John 15:5-6</i>'
