message: 'Hi David,
  The words of Scripture have specific meanings.  If you pray the Lords Prayer (for example) with focus <em>on the meaning of each phrase</em>, this is not vain repetition.  "Lead us not into temptation" means just what it says.
  
  To take that phrase and to treat it as disconnected sounds, or to assign ones own private and personal meaning to it that has nothing to do with the plain meaning is a dangerous practice.
  
  If you want to think about the life of Christ,  read the Gospels and meditate on what you read there.  Keep close to the Scriptures and a tight rein on your imagination and you will do well.
  
  Keep close to your imagination and far from the Scriptures and you are on dangerous ground.
  
  God bless you, David.'
