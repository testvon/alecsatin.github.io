message: 'so u r saying that repetitive praying (hail marys) while meditating an certain aspects of Christs life is unpleasing to Him?
  i believe there is no definitive proof one way or another in scripture (your scripture cited is VAIN repititious prayer which is not the same as honest Christ-focused repitious prayer).
  but because the rosary comes from the catholic church it is branded as evil without any honest investigation.
  granted the CC is full of erroneous doctrine.
  honest, sincere, non-vain prayer from the heart is not offensive to God and you are arrogant to assume as such without concrete scripture to back it up. ANY VAIN prayer is offensive to God regardless of its origin.'
