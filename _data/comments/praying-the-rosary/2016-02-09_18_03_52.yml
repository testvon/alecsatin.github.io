message: 'Actually its mostly the latter. This is how these folks were raised from childhood and many will be buried clutching their beads. I too said the rosary often in my youth, mostly for indulgences for a dead member of the parish (but the word indulgence was never spoken)  however I realized it was thoughtless repetition with everyones mind in neutral.
  
  It never occurred to me until later that theres 10 Hail Marys for each Lords Prayer, and even if praying to a dead woman was biblical, thats still upside down, GOD should be the recipient of all prayers, not 10%. The rosary was supposedly given to St. Dominic, the founder of the Dominican order, by Mary in a vision in the early 12th century, and these visits by Mary have been discussed here recently. The history of the rosary is as interesting as it is dreadful, because each recitation of the Hail Mary drives a wedge deeper between man and God, and the true originator of the rosary probably meant it to be that way.'
