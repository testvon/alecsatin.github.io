message: 'Wonderful post Alec. Ive been dealing with this for some time now; I spent a lot of my life defending the country (which the bible has no problem with) but looking back on my feelings, this country has become an idol to me, competing with God for my love and adoration. The false idol had to go. My interest in the American government is now tempered by Romans 13:1
  
  Every person is to be in subjection to the governing nameities. For there is no nameity except from God, and those which exist are established by God.'
