message: 'Whew!!    Thats a relief;  we bloggers had a big scare a few years back where it was rumored we had to link to the provenance of any article or image we used;  it was the typical "Theyre out to get Republican and shut you down!" which, of course, never happened.  So Im a little sensitive to this stuff...
  Sorry to get worried...this is not the normal situation regarding movies!
  Good for them!   And good for you.
  Will try to watch later.'
