  In junior high school in the 60s I ran into new math which wanted to be relevant.  But it was hard to know if it was because it was so convoluted and abstract.  After 2 years of that I went from being competent in math to confused and unable to progress in the new algebra. It hampered me for life in math.  Im sick to see all this experimentation when they already know what works!
  
  Video - sickening.  I was 18 when they lowered the voting age to 18. I and said at the time its moving the wrong direction.  It should have been raised to 25.  The video demonstrates why the elites, historically, wanted to keep governance out of the hands of the masses.  These children should never enter a voting booth.'
