message: 'Needless to say, new math bears a not surprising resemblance to the confusion in the Common Core sheet you posted.  Remember Tom Lehrers wonderful satires set to music?  He was also a mathematician (he eventually taught it at UC Santa Cruz), and his piece on <a href="https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=tom%20lehrer%20new%20math" rel="nofollow">New Math</a> was cleverly animated for a school project.  Enjoy!'
