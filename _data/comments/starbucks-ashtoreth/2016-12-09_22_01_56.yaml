message: 'Very interesting, Jul.  Atargatis seems to be a later derivation.  From Wikipedia:
  
  <em>The name Atargatis derives from the Aramaic form ‘Atar‘atheh...‘Atar‘atheh is seen as a continuation of Bronze Age goddesses. At Ugarit, cuneiform tablets attest the three great Canaanite goddesses Aṭirat (Asherah) — described as a fecund "Lady Goddess of the Sea" (rabbatu at̪iratu yammi) — ‘Anat (Anat, Anath), and ‘Ațtart (Astarte), who shared many traits with each other and may have been worshiped in conjunction or separately during 1500 years of cultural history.</em>

  Not sure why you felt the need to call me, "ignorant" in your subject header.  You seem to agree with the main point of the post, which is that the Starbucks logo depicts an ancient pagan deity.
  
  Thanks for your comment.  Had never heard of this Syrian idol Atargatis.  You taught me something, and for that I appreciate you.
