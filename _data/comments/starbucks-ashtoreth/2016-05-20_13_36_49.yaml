message: 'Hi Denise,
  You are not alone in your experiences with the visible church.  This is a dark age and a time of apostasy.  Yet God knows those that are his.  He will not allow you to be tested beyond what you are able to bear.
  
  How fortunate you are to have a father who believes.
  
  In regard to Luther, church fathers, etc, some knowledgeable people I respect have said that the most important book is the Bible.  Later is the Book of Concord, the best and most Biblical book of theology.  Luthers sermons are considered more definitive of him than his Table Talks.
  
  In one sense, who cares if intrigue and deception were part of the Lutheran Reformation?  We dont follow men.  We follow the Son of God.  We follow the Word.
  
  The only light in the world comes through the Word.  This world lies in darkness.  It should not surprise us (though it often does) that there have been deceivers and deceived infiltrating the visible church from the beginning.  Rick Warren, Willow Creek, et al, thank God you can see through that muck.  Lots of people are blind.  God help us all.
  
  Keep me posted Denise.<br />
  Alec'
