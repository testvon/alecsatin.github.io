message: 'Hi Robyn,
  I really do appreciate your comment.  Thinking a little more, I wonder if youre aware of the very common occult principle of exoteric and esoteric?  In brief, followers of the mystery schools like to embed multiple meanings in their symbols and rituals.  There is a exoteric - outward, visible - meaning which is given to outsiders.  There is also one or more than one esoteric - hidden - meaning or meanings.  So I agree with you that the Moby Dick siren is one meaning of the logo.  I believe this is the exoteric one given to the poor shlubs who do not know what the real symbol means.  Did I mention that occultists love to laugh at those outside?
  
  Just some things to think about.<br />
  Alec'
