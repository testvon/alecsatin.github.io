  Lucifer is NOT called the Morning Star... he is called 'son of the morning!'
  Only in the modern and dangerously misleading bible versions is he thus
  called. God does not call God, Satan, sarcastically or otherwise. But thanks
  for an interesting read, I'm studying this subject because I recently heard a
  professing Christian say that Jesus calls himself 'Venus' in the Rev 22:16
  scripture.
