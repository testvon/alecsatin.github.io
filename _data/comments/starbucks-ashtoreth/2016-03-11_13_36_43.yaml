message: 'Thank you! I knew that Asherah / Ashtoreth worship was on the rise, I wasnt aware of the Asherah / Ashtoreth link to Starbucks. They claim that their "little mermaid" is based on a 16th century Norse woodcut, however Norsemen were socially extinct by the 13th century. I found one site that tracked this to Melusine, the demon progenitress of the Plantagenet kings and the alchemist symbol of fertility and transformation.
  
  The point is that symbols are important. If you wear a cross you can be identified as a Christian, unless you wear it upside down then you can be identified as a Satanist, or if its a maltese cross you can be identified as a biker. Symbols last a very long time, One ancient symbol that is still "all the rage" today in Eastern Europe and Western asia is the "Evil Eye" (which I fully never understood, but they believe in it)
  
  want to see something scarey?
