  For those who wont take the time to read Dougs article, this is one of the main points:
  
  <em>Out of fashion for 4,000 years, asherah poles have shown up in night clubs and hip restaurants in Los Angeles and Miami, where patrons consider them trendy, mystical symbols of ancient power.
  
  “People want to connect to something with ancient roots, not some modern religion,” says a night club owner who added carved, modern-looking poles to his facility. “People rub them to get good luck with their careers and relationships.”
  
  But a Jewish watchdog group has begun surreptitiously stealing or cutting the poles down, leaving unattractive stumps.
  
  “It’s a little too close to what we went through thousands of years ago, when asherah worship meant anti-Semitism,” says a rabbi who has organized the effort. “If there weren’t power in these symbols, people wouldn’t be attracted to them.”</em>
  
  Heres the current iteration of an Asherah Pole, from the article:

  And heres what believers used to do if they saw one in person:

  Fear the Lord, people.
  
  Great find, Doug.
