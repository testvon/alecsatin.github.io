  An lcms pastor condemnig the use of occult symbols!!
  Luthers symbol, the rosy cross is also a symbol of the rosicrucians.  Its also a pentagram.  Almost every symbol used in our Lutheran churches have esoteric, occult meanings.  Didnt Luther say in his "Table talk " he thought alchemy was a good thing?  Didnt one of the names of the book of concord practice astrology?   Wasnt Jacob Andrae a Rosicrucian??? Im am a cradle lcms Christian who, after rebellion then evangelism is trying to be comfortable with these facts.
  It greatly disturbs me.  Also, why the hell does my lcms confessional lutheran pastor say, "Blessed and holy be his name" everytime he quotes that idol Martin Luther?'
