message: 'Starbuck is the name of a character from Moby Dick, and this is where the name is from. The image is a siren. It goes with the Moby Dick theme. Finally, in the quote you used about Starbucks "image," shes talking about the image people have about the company, not the logo. I dont think we should patronize Starbucks because they have loudly opposed Christianity, not because people are seeing a demonic goddess in the logo.'
