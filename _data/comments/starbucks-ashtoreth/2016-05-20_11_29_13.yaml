message: 'Hi Denise,
  First, I am not a pastor, nor do I attend an LCMS church.  I used to attend a WELS church, but became so disgusted by the sinful culture of cover-up and denial that I had to leave.  Before that my experience has been in evangelical churches.
  
  Having said that, I want to thank you so much for your comment.  You are the first person who has brought up this very real aspect of Martin Luther.  Its seriously disturbing, to be sure.  Can you provide any references to back up what youre saying?  I remember hearing a radio show in the 1990s in which the speaker, Bill Cooper, suggested similar things about the Lutheran Cross symbol.  If I remember correctly, he has suggested that Luther was a member of a secret society which had the goal of destroying the Roman Catholic Church.  Theres a sort of sense in Coopers hypothesis.  Luther said so often that he had no desire to create a new church, but rather to bring it back to Biblical truth and practice.  Would it be so hard to imagine that he was used by a secret society which had infiltrated his order?  They meant it for evil, but God used everything for good (Rom 8.28).
  
  We know that secret societies have tried for many centuries to control monarchs and governments.  The Jesuit order in the RCC could be considered a secret society which is now well in control of that 1 billion member church.
  
  Alchemy (witchcraft) is clearly condemned by Luther and in the book of Concord.  In the small catechism: <em>We should fear and love God that we may not curse, swear, use witchcraft, lie, or deceive by His name, but call upon it in every trouble, pray, praise, and give thanks.</em>
  
  Astrology and witchcraft are both condemned in the Bible.
  
  In regard to your pastors saying, "Blessed and holy be his name", that sounds uncomfortably close to blasphemy to me.  True Biblical Christians, which Lutherans claim to be, understand that only God himself is holy and without sin.  "Hallowed be thy name" applies to God in the Lords Prayer - not man.  You might quietly and humbly tell the pastor that his use of this phrase in regard to Luther is causing you to stumble.  If he chooses not to correct it, try to find another church.
  
  The Visible Church serves the body of Christians.  The body of Christians do not belong to the pastors of the Visible Church.  We belong to Christ alone.
  
  May God bless you and keep you, Denise.
  Alec'
