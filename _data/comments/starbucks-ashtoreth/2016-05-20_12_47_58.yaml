message: 'Thankyou for your nice reply.  I am sorry I was so snarky.  I typed so fast and there was no proof texting.  I am spiritually and emotionally tired of all the deception
    I want to honor my Lord and Savior in the way He wants me to honor Him, not mans ways.  I became  burnt out of trying almost every evangelical church.  Each church followed Rick Warren or Willow Creek. I was so happy  to find my Lutheran roots were grounded in the word of God.  My dad is  a staunch LCMS Lutheran.  I was attempting to "save" my dad, Jesus showed me how wrong I was.  Now, I am so discouraged about the lifestyles of the Lutheran Fathers and secret society infiltration I am losing all hope.  References regarding Luther liking Alchemy are in his book "Table Talk" , no sure which chapter.   I dont trust Makow but he does have useful information.   There is a website called "Watch Unto Prayer".  Its very out there but if you look at Reformation, Rosicrucian connections article you will find info.  Also, google Jacob Andrae and Melanchthon, astrology. Thankyou'
