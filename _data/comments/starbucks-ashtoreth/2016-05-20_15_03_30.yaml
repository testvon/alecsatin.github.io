message: 'I was asked about Andreae and Luther by the blogmaster, who is serious about presenting the truth. I have a PhD in theology and have written about the Reformation for about 40 years. Luther had no use for the occult or magic. He was a little superstitious by our standards, but he was always quick to point out the Satanic origin of the dark arts. Any resemblance between the Luther rose and the Rosicrucian garbage is pure coincidence or a matter of trying to copy Luther, who was the giant of the Reformation. Satan always apes the church to draw people into falsehood.
  
  The Table Talks are copied down from dinner at Luthers home, by various people. The scribes were not always good at their job, so what do we gather from casual conversation? I did not see an actual citation - Volume, page number, plus the exact quotation. A vague recollection of something that might be in a book of eavesdroppers - not significant to me. I heard Jimmy Hoffa was buried in the endzone of  a football stadium - but that is not proof.
  
  The Andreae who helped get the Book of Concord started was related to the person linked with the occult - his grandfather - from what I can gather from one link - https://books.google.com/books?id=d5d_AhziPZsC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=jacob+andreae+rosicrucian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OX8o7Kbylc&amp;sig=wrrUl9BRVFsSfJs5o4NWDoT8HSM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTqty48ujMAhXCMGMKHRUMDukQ6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=jacob%20andreae%20rosicrucian&amp;f=false - p. 19.
  
  The Jacob Andreae associated with the Book of Concord is not studied much at all by anyone. Luther is studied but many have an axe to grind.'
