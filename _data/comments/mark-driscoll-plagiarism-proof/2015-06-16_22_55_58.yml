message: 'Thank YOU, Alec...I REALLY appreciate your insight above...youve changed my mind.  It just sounded like shed lassod him and your background information shows me she was RIGHT.
  Im a kind of hard nosed on this stuff so I even surprised myself by sticking up for the pastor, but I do agree with you now..and with the others whove found hes plagiarized.
  Particularly if he used a kind of defense thats typical these days...not good.
  
  I still dont look at it as the end of the world as far as faith;  heres a pastor who might or might not have meant to do this, but if hes done this on a serial type of basis and used that hackneyed defense thing, Im on her side.
  
  Also, it seems silly if his books are good, beneficial books to read, not to quote ...whats the downside?   Sad..he tumbled for nothing.  All he had to do was be honest.
  
  Thanks.'
