message: 'Since Mefferds interview, more proof of plagiarism over multiple books came forward.  It was a huge story, which eventually led to Mark Driscolls resignation.  Dr ES Williams <a href="http://www.driscollcontroversy.com/?page_id=916" rel="nofollow">writes</a>:
  
  <blockquote>The evidence quoted above leaves little doubt that Mark Driscoll, the name of many ‘Christian’ books, is a serial plagiarizer. The significance of Driscoll’s plagiarism is that it reveals much about his character. It seems he is prepared to use other people’s intellectual work and writings, and pass them off as his own.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>After reviewing the material, I don’t think the concerns being raised can be accurately represented as a witch hunt. Efforts to characterize those who raise inconvenient facts as engaging in a smear campaign or witch hunt are misplaced and unhelpful ...However, in my view, these new concerns are not frivolous and should be taken seriously.</blockquote>
  
  The attacks on Mefferd are actually a common response from Church Growth Pastors when questioned.  The first response is usually along the lines of, "Aw shucks, were all friends here."  If this doesnt work to deflect the criticism, then it becomes, "You are being mean" or "That is a violation of the seventh/eighth commandment".  If these dont work, then it becomes character assassination behind the scenes and ad hominem attack to the person directly.
  
  Its understandable that people in the Church would like to ignore this and push it under the rug.  However, these things never go away.  People who are motivated by power are almost always more determined to hold on to it than other people are ready to question them.  The longer institutional problems are ignored, the harder they are to face and correct.
  
  Sure appreciate your thoughts, Z.  Thanks for your comment!
