message: 'Perhaps if shed brought up the whole thing at the beginning and let  him respond that he knew Dr Jones and, if hed been negligent in citing him, hed check into that, it wouldnt have started to sound exactly what Christians are sounding like these days "going for the jugular and making points for themselves" than covering a very worthwhile subject?  Also, most interviewers tell a guest what theyll cover and it sounded like this hit him broadside.
  Frankly, Im surprised at Mefferd.   It doesnt sound like the Pastor has a history of plagiarizing and his editors should have caught this stuff.
  How big a story in the Christian world is this getting?   Im not that plugged in in that way.??'
