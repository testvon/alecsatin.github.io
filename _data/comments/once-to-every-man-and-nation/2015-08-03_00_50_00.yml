message: 'The lyrics to this notable and wonderful Christian song / hymn are timeless! The pointed words are there to challenge every Christian generation. Its message is not for weak-kneed Christians but for those disciples of Christ who are willing to rebuke the cultures deeds of darkness and to carry on with practical Gospel Truth. Actions of genuine discipleship which trump the talk of feeble fence-sitting "belief!"'
