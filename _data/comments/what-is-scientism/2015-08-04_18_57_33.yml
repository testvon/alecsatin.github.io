message: 'OH, yes it has.....Witness the new Pope chatting up global climate change instead of constantly reminding our world of Islamist terror toward Christians, the thousands of Christians, adults and children, killed by ISIS.  Whats more important?
  
  And our president, too......I thought BLACK LIVES MATTER, a very Christian viewpoint;  instead, he does little about that but stir things up, sadly, and push for scientific topics such as our energy plants, etc......which is also important but Id sure like to see a push toward protecting Christians and Jews.....
  
  Im hoping someone here says "no" and presents a good argument that Christianity is winning.  Of course, we know we WILL always win, as did CS Lewis.'
