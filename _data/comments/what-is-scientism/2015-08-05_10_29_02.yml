  Can we stop equating the voluntary donation of certain fetal tissues by mothers with sales of dead babies?

  Ummm yes we can if certain people would get off their high horse and stop trying to poke their collective moral nose into other peoples business. The issue is the fact that those with these "moral issues" have absolutely no clue about the actual science of it all.

  Pretty judgmental of my qualifications young man. What do YOU know of what I know? My guess is nothing.
  You and Obama have a thing about accusing people of people being on "their high horse", I notice.
  Yet youre sitting pretty tall in the saddle with your attitude.

  How does science excuse the murder of a baby that could survive ex utero, my friend?
  And where is the exaggeration in calling the killing of a baby and selling the parts barbaric?
  BTW, I wasnt resting my argument on my age, but on my knowledge of things scientific.

  You see it as murder. Other parts of society with an equal amount of people see it differently. Who are we to decide which side is right and wrong? Let people do whats right for them. I cant stand scare tactics. BTW youre correct. I called you out on your knowledge of science and I should not have done that. I dont know you and I apologize for that.

  Thank you. I appreciate a reasoned discussion, even if we disagree.'
