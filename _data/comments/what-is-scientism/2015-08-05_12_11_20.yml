message: 'Ed, thank you for saving this exchange here for posterity.  Youve illustrated not only the murderous arrogance of Scientisms followers (and they will kill fully grown humans too if they get the power to do so), but their denial to recognize their crusade.  Sadly, it doesnt sound like these two are movers and shakers at all, but simply miseducated into their lying faith.
  
  Good for you for being willing to interact with these folks.  We can never know when something we say may actually pierce their defenses and let a little truth in.  On the other hand, <em>Dont cast your pearls before swine, lest after trampling them underfoot, they turn and rend you</em> also applies at some point.'
