  I think this is an important topic, although I can relate to "Comedy Pluss" frustration. Its similar to Ferlinghettis line about seeing "the best minds of our generation destroyed by boredom at poetry readings."
  
  Sound doctrine is really a matter of life and death, health and illness. For many years I labored under the false teaching that my acceptance by God depended on my performance—did I pray enough, fast enough, read the Scripture enough, and on and on—the answer whispered in my ear, "No! Not enough, not near enough, youre probably not even a true Christian!"
  
  God in His mercy, however, taught me about grace—undeserved favor—how that it is CHRISTS performance in my behalf (as I am united with Him by faith) that makes me acceptable to our heavenly Father.
  
  This and similar teachings are called the Doctrines of Grace, which allow the child of God in Christ to REST in his heavenly Fathers care, trusting His providence and guidance so that the life of faith is a joy, even in the midst of suffering—the presence of God being the source of joy.
  
  Sound and wisely applied doctrine promotes robust spiritual life. Thank you for your remarks above!
  
  Steve'
