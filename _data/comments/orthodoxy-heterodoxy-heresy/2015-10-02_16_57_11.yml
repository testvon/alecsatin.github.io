message: 'Just as a follow up, this above comment has resulted in stronger abuse and invective from this person.  If you are still reading Dan, you are not displaying gentlemanly behavior.  So I will be absolutely clear what I mean, here is the Websters Unabridged definition of abuse:  <em>to attack or injure with words : reproach coarsely</em>.  Your words in your response to the Keith Green post definitely fit that definition.
  
  Since you continue to abuse, I cannot see how we are having a discussion or conversation.
  
  I do care for you, and hope that you will consider my lengthy response to your first post.
  
  Alec
  
  PS For the sake of fairness, Dan considers my remarks about him (above) slanderous.  He says that he did not mean any abuse.  I will give him the benefit of the doubt, but will not continue the conversation.'
