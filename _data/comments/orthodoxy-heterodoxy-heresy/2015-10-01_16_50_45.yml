  Be that as it may - and, I have my suspicions that you have many frustrations from past "church experience," that has left you staying away because you have been agitated rather than blessed.
  
  However, dont allow yourself to grow stagnant. Daily read your Bible and pray. Meet informally with other Christians to encourage one another and pray for one another.'
