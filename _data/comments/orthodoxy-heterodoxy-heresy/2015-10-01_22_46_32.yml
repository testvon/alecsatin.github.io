message: 'Hi Dan,
  
  Thank you so much for writing.
  
  If you look around at some of the other posts on <em>While its yet day</em>, youll see (I hope) that my perspective is quite critical of what is generally known as <em>American Christianity</em>.  In the social-political commentary posts, one theme I try to get across is the con game of liberal-conservative, left-right, and republican-democrat.  These divisions are artificial constructs cynically used to divide people, poison conversation and point us at each other rather than looking for the true causes of the issues that are making us consistently less free.
  
  All of that is just to say that my mind does not work using the models of "liberal Christan" or "soundly conservative".  None of the men you mentioned - Chuck Swindoll, Billy Graham, Leonard Ravenhill, Jonathan Edwards, CS Lewis - would be people Id point anyone to.  Id go even further to say that Im not aware of any Christian denomination in American of any size that is not <em>significantly troubled</em> by non-Biblical teaching.  The denomination youve come from, Southern Baptist, is among the worst.  Im so sorry that you have grown up drinking from such a well.  Its completely understandable that you have pulled away as you have.  You drank poison!  Thank God it did not kill you.  I know that it didnt kill you because you are (a) still physically alive and (b) respectfully looking into these things.
  
  Before moving to your questions, let me add one more thing.  Those elect of God who respond to the Holy Spirit who works through the written Word of God, are all sinners saved by grace alone.  The salvation is Gods work.  Our ability to respond is the result of Gods work.  Faith itself is Gods gift.  He saves. We can add nothing.
  
  Now, to your observations.
  
  <blockquote>
    (Dan writes:) IF we MUST be "right" on every topic (or even a subset of "several topics") that, to me, comes much too close to the notion of being saved by our own genius, not by Gods grace.
  </blockquote>
  
  Exactly correct.  It is not up to us to be "right" on every topic, or even most topics.  But as we spend more time with the Scriptures, the Holy Spirit leads us into greater understanding and - as importantly - greater humility and compassion.  The written Bible is Jesus Christ in a very real way (John 1.1).  Reading it, memorizing it, and thinking about it changes us from the inside out.
  
  <em>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, [even] as by the Spirit of the Lord. -2 Corinthians 3.18</em>
  
  <blockquote>
    (Dan writes:) My concern: I fear that many conservative brothers and sisters confuse the notion of "being sincerely mistaken about a topic/some topics" with being a false teacher.
  </blockquote>
  
  They may very well think this way.  Thats why we have to go back to the Word and be careful about confusing what people say with what God says.
  
  <blockquote>
    (Dan writes:) When false teachers are talked about in the Bible, they are almost without fail, specifically NOT the merely mistaken, but those who are being deliberately deceitful.
  </blockquote>
  
  Its not possible to know whats in another persons heart.  We can only see the outworking.  People who intend to deceive often are quite good at it.  So we can only compare what they say/teach/write with what the Scripture says.  If, like someone in the Latter Day Saints church, they tell us that Jesus is a created being, then we know that they are a false teacher.  Is that Mormon who tells me this trying to deceive me?  I dont think so.  Is he sincere in his faith?  Yes.  Is he more outwardly moral than some or even many mainstream Christians?  Quite possibly so.  But is he teaching heresy?  Yes.  Need we consider him a non-Christian/ unbeliever?  Definitely.  This is not my choice or yours.  Its what God tells us we must do.  Its not optional.
  
  <em>A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition reject; Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself -Titus 3.10-11</em>
  
  <blockquote>
    (Dan writes:) Instead, we sincerely read Gods Word, sincerely pray and seek Gods ways and, as a result, sincerely disagree with fellow Christians on topics like the historic interpretations of Genesis or on marriage rights for gay folk or on Christians taking part in wars or investing, etc.
  </blockquote>
  
  These are all serious issues.  If you (Dan) believe that the Bible is Gods Word, and come to it wanting to understand, rather than bringing preconceptions to it and making the Bible conform to those ideas, then you may find your positions changing in unpredictable ways.  True Christians are continually trying to understand how to live honestly and justly in a fallen world.  Its not easy with sin (our own and others), the flesh and the Devil working against us.  But God is greater than these three.
  
  When a well-known conservative Christian pastor who I will not name rejects certain parts of Genesis because he doesnt think they are correct as written, he is betraying his lack of faith in the Bible.  Even some militant haters of Christianity understand that all of the Bible rests on the factual accuracy of Genesis.  If Genesis is fable, then the whole lock, stock and barrel of Christianity gets thrown out.
  
  <blockquote>
    (Dan writes:) We sincerely disagree with more conservative folk just as they sincerely disagree with us.
  </blockquote>
  
  This is the first thing youve written that concerns me.  Whos the "we"?  No "we" cares about you, Dan.  The "we"s in the world only care about power.  I care about you, because youve taken the trouble to reach out to me and weve connected here.
  
  <blockquote>
    (Dan writes:) Do you allow for the distinction between those who might deliberately lie...vs those who are sincerely disagreeing on some of these topics?
  </blockquote>
  
  Heres the real question as I see it Dan.  Do you consider the Bible more true than your current ideas, or do you consider yourself the judge of the Bible? This question is the best measure of a Christian soul.
  
  Hope this is helpful.  May God bless you. 
  Alec'
