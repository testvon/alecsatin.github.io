message: 'Hello, I ran across your website via your visit to the Winging It blog and, if you dont mind, I have a few questions to politely raise.
  
  First of all, my name is Dan and I grew up Southern Baptist and thoroughly conservative traditional. My fans as a teen and a young man were (well, besides Jesus and the heroes of the Bible) Chuck Swindoll, Billy Graham, Leonard Ravenhill, Jonathan Edwards, CS Lewis, etc - ie, I was a soundly conservative Christian. While I am still a Christian and still appreciate those who raised me in that tradition (teaching me to take my walk with Jesus seriously, teaching me to take the Bible seriously and to read and pray without ceasing), I am now in the camp that most conservatives would call "liberal Christian," and many others would call a heretic. I am not a heretic, I believe in and am saved by Jesus, the risen son of God, who came preaching repentance and a salvation by Gods grace, not one of works. IF we MUST be "right" on every topic (or even a subset of "several topics") that, to me, comes much too close to the notion of being saved by our own genius, not by Gods grace. I, sinner that I am and imperfect, but sincere, am glad to fall on Gods grace for salvation.
  
  With that said...
  
  You cite Peter and biblical instructions/warnings about "false teachers"...
  
  <i>But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily (secretly) shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. </i>
  
  My concern: I fear that many conservative brothers and sisters confuse the notion of "being sincerely mistaken about a topic/some topics" with being a false teacher. When false teachers are talked about in the Bible, they are almost without fail, specifically NOT the merely mistaken, but those who are being deliberately deceitful. In the passage you cite, it talks about them "secretly" bringing in heresies and "denying the Lord..." But there are many, many of us who are doing nothing secretly, nor are we denying the Lord. Instead, we sincerely read Gods Word, sincerely pray and seek Gods ways and, as a result, sincerely disagree with fellow Christians on topics like the historic interpretations of Genesis or on marriage rights for gay folk or on Christians taking part in wars or investing, etc. We sincerely disagree with more conservative folk just as they sincerely disagree with us.
  
  My question to you/concern I have about what youre saying is, Do you allow for the distinction between those who might deliberately lie and try to cause disruptions for reasons of power or money (as is usually specifically mentioned in the Bible) vs those who are sincerely disagreeing on some of these topics?
  
  In Christ,
  
  Dan Trabue'
