  While reading it I could not help but think of 2 past friendships Ive had with 2 Catholics. Both professed to be Christian and one professed a personal relationship with Jesus. Both are immersed in Catholic Church doctrine via beliefs / observances.
  
  That "immersion" in Catholic Church doctrine (in time) became to me to be a huge roadblock to a continuing friendship. With the one friend, he became obnoxious and mean when (to the understanding of my wife and me) he could not make in-roads with us, to lead us to the "true church."
  
  Both friends are highly intelligent and decent people. I believe the one, has allowed false Catholic church beliefs and practices to "over-cloud" (aka, interfere) with that one Catholics, lifes calling. This has vexed me so much that I now perceive the friendship from a very distant perspective.
  
  Ive come to the conclusion that even acquaintances and friendships are only able to reach a certain level (point) before they become "thudded" and even "disintegrate." If one in a friendship tenaciously holds to false doctrines, that in itself, can cease any progression of friendship; and, may very well spell an end to that friendship.
  
  Genuine friendships are never meant to grow stagnant. But that is what transpires when the poison of false doctrine (teachings) continually shadow a persons life. "Iron sharpens iron." But when iron rusts (due the deadening forces of nature) that sharpening process is halted.
  
  "As iron sharpens iron, so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend." - Proverbs 27:17
  
  What does the Bible say?
  
  "Can two walk together except they be agreed?" - Amos 3:3'
