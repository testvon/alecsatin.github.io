  Dan Trabue has been blocked from multiple blogs because he isnt just "mistaken," rather he is a blatant and rank heretic who always tries to get people to agree with him.  He worships a whole other Jesus than the one of the Bible, and another god rather than the God of the Bible.

  Ignore Dans sophistry.  Oh, and he will most likely call me out for "false witness" or "slander," etc, because that is his usual routine.
  
  Just warning you so you dont get bogged down in lengthy discussions with a person who has been proven to be unteachable.'
