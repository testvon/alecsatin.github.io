  Sandy has passed on.  We know that all things the Lord does are altogether good and perfect.
  
  Salvation is a strange thing, full of wonder and set up to make us humble before God.  Who knows how and why some believe?  He has mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardens (Romans 9.18).
  
  Praised be the name of the Lord.'
