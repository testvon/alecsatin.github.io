  Sadly, it was too late for my aunt.  She passed away.  I cant help but feel the blood on my hands.  How many people dont know about Christ, dont know about the only way to be reconciled to the real God.  Wishful thinking wont help any of us in the end.<br />
  Thank you for your comment.
  Warmly,
  Alec'
