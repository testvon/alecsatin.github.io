message: 'Ive just been reading about this era in our history called "A Crown For Elizabeth" by Mary M. Luke. This period of time is of special interest to me. Its when great reformation took place in England and the Continent. Tyndale is briefly touched in that book. Anyway, Tyndale was a brave, God fearing man. I admire such men for wanting to share Gods word with everyone when it was such a dangerous thing to do. Pulling away from the paganism of Roman helped create the middle class. Protestantism also gave more freedom for people to be free thinkers, create and explore than any other religion. Excellent lesson. Thanks Alec. Hope your day is blessed. ~:)'
