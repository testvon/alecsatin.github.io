message: 'Marvelous post!  I read a very good book on Tyndale this year, and so enjoyed this post!  Thank you for that closing post script.  I did not know about Henry 8 disseminating the book.
  
  As a wordsmith I was particularly taken with the rich vocabulary Tyndale added to our language.  Its said that without him or Cranmer (book of prayer) we would not have had Shakespeare.
  
  I got these from <i>Tyndale, The Man Who Gave God an English Voice</i>  by David Teems:
  Words Tyndale set adrift into the English language include: thanksgiving, godspeed, network, excommunicate, Jehovah, passover, intercession, holy place, atonement, mercy seat, judgment seat, chasten, impure, longed, apostleship, brotherly, whoremonger, viper, godless.
  
  And phrases: 
  Behold the lamb of god
  I am the way, the truth and the life
  in my fathers house are many mansions
  for thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory
  Seek and ye shall find.
  With God all things are possible. 
  Looking unto Jesus, the name and finisher of our faith.
  Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
  Let not your hearts be troubled.
  The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
  
  One can certainly see how the church in nameity did not like the subtle implications of Tyndales vocabulary shifts - congregation for church, and so one, as many diminished them at every turn.  Its a good example for us today - as we see the MSM doing the same with cherished values and laws.'
