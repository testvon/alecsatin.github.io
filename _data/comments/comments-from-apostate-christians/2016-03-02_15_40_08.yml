  I just want to clarify a few things (if you will allow it).
  
  First, when I say the Bible isnt my supreme guide to beliefs and practices, I mean I dont follow every command found in the Bible equally. I put added weight on following the Biblical teachings and actions of Christ. I am a Christian after all.
  
  Secondly there is nothing about the gospel I deny.
  -All are separated from God by sin.
  -Faith in Jesus is the only way to salvation.
  -There will be judgement for those that are not redeemed through Christ.
  
  So, when you say I am undermining the true gospel, I am not sure what gospel you are talking about.
  
  Finally, I did not follow you here. You post a link to your blog on every site you post comments to. You want people to come here. I like and enjoy a lot of what you are posting, but that doesnt mean there isnt tertiary beliefs that Christians can have healthy debate about.  I personally believe a Christians view of war and violence is one of those beliefs we can debate.'
