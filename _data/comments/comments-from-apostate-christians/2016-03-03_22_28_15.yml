message: 'Ah LPC, that seems to be the heart of the matter.  This is why my suspicion is that Josh is a young man who has fallen under teachings common in the so called Emerging Church.  Specifically, Jesus words are nameitative, but Pauls and those in the OT scriptures are not.
  
  Josh says that he accepts all Scripture.  Yet he himself ranks the importance of any particular verse or passage.  Does not this make Josh the nameity over the Word?
  
  He is angry at me for not allowing this discussion to continue.  But he can argue back at Stans blog, cited in the post.  Stan has more of a stomach for false gospels than I.
  
  I hope that Josh is just misguided.  May God lead him (and all of us) into all truth.
  
  The other man though cited in this post is a hateful person evidencing no respect for Jesus Christ or his word.  Scary that such run rampant in Christian circles.
  
  Thanks for your comment.
  Alec'
