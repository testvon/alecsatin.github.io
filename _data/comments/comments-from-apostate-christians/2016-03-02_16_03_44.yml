  Ultimately our salvation is between us and God.  I cannot judge your heart or your relationship with God, nor care to do so.  I can only make decisions based on what people say and do.
  
  In the thread at Stans place, you made these comments:
  
  <em>We must reexamine the violent portrayal of God in the OT, because we now have the clearest picture of what God is like. Most of the violent portrayals of God in the OT can be explained by God removing his protection and allowing evil murderous entities to do their work. He does not murder, but allows it in certain circumstances. </em>
  
  and
  
  <em>If you put the Bible above what Jesus says you are the one that rejects Gods WORD. </em>
  
  Now it is possible that I am misunderstanding what you have written.  But these seem to indicate an elevation of some parts of Scripture over others.  They also seem to misunderstand the nature of God and of the Old Testament.  God does kill people.  The men of Bet Shemesh in 1 Samuel.  Or Uzzah in 2 Samuel.
  
  Its possible that you have just been the recipient of bad teaching.  I asked you this in the thread at Stans place to give you the benefit of the doubt.  You chose not to answer.
  
  Is all Scripture given by inspiration of God, without error and equally profitable for training and instruction in righteousness?  Or are the words of Jesus more important?
  
  If the words of Jesus are more important to you, than we have little to discuss.
  
  Alec'
