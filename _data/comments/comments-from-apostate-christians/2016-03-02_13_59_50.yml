message: 'I think your buddy Josh needs to sit down and prayerfully get his story straight. "Is the Bible the inerrant, infallible, word of God? Yes. Is Jesus the WORD of God? Yes. Is Jesus the whole point of the Bible? Yes." but when pressed as to what is his guide to beliefs and practices he responds "the bible isnâ€™t my supreme guide to beliefs and practices"
  
  Now wait a moment, He admits that the bible is the inerrant, infallible word of God, he admits that Jesus is the word of God, and he admits that the bible is all about Jesus, but hes going to reject the inerrant, infallible word of God which is Jesus to follow Jesus?
  
  He rejects Jesus so he can follow Jesus? If the bible is the word of God, and Jesus is God, then the bible is the word of Jesus, but he rejects the word of Jesus to follow Jesus. My next question would be "WHAT JESUS ARE YOU FOLLOWING?" (and yes, Id ask it pretty loudly)
  
  Hes not apostate, hes confused. Very very confused. And he may need to learn to check multiple bible versions. Because in John 2:15the NASB and the ESV say "And He made a scourge of cords, and drove them all out of the temple, WITH the sheep and the oxen..." - but interpreting the fact that some verses say both and some say with may be a job for Pastor Paratus, hes MUCH better at Greek than I am (by about 1000%)'
