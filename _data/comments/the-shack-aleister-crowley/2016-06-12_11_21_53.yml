message: 'Hi Maria.
  I had hoped to never again have to think about "The Shack".  But just like the other occultist darlings, the Harry Potter series of books, "The Shack" keeps working its poisonous spell throughout America and the world.  Its pure Satanism seen through a Christian veil.
  God help us.
  (And he is, praised be his name.)
  
  Be well, Maria, and thank you again for bringing attention to this obscure documentary.
  
  Alec'
