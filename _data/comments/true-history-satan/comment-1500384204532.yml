message: "Satanists only use the name \"Lucifer\" because throughout history Christians were calling him that.  To use them as evidence for Lucifer's name is anachronistic.\r\n\r\nLucifer never was his name, as I explain in my article about the history of the name \"Lucifer\" and how it became associated with Satan.  Isaiah 14 never used to be understood as Satan until the passage was spiritualized by Tertullian and Origen.  Just by reading the passage itself, no one would come to that conclusion.\r\n\r\nAnd that's why us evangelicals who know the history of the name reject it."
