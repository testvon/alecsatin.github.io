message: "Hi Glenn,\r\n\r\nWhat about the Ezekiel 28:11?  Do you reject typology in Scripture?\r\n\r\nForcing a solely literal hermeneutic on prophetic writings is a choice some make.  But that is not how all Christians (or Jews in the inter-testamental period) have understood prophecy.  \r\n\r\nDo you agree with the background provided in the bulk of Bible passages referenced in this article?  If so, it would have been nice to hear that instead of reiterating your arguments about Lucifer not being Satan, which you and I have gone over before.\r\n\r\nIn any case, thank you as always for reading and commenting.  Let's take this discussion to email if you'd like to continue.\r\n\r\nAlec"
