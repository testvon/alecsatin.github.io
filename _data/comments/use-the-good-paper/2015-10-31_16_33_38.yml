message: 'As a water color artist, I loved that use the good paper phrase....we can work hard and make a wonderful image but if weve used less than good paper, its not the best final image.  In a way, in this example, use the good paper means, to me, that the materials we start with can be easier built upon to excellence.
  If we are our good paper, living close to Gods Word and all that implies, our output goes to contributing to a more beautiful world.'
