message: 'Dinnerware from Buffalo China was used in fancy restaurants and diners throughout the country.  Ive seen some (vintage) new Buffalo China made in the 1950s(?) which was heavy, sturdy, and beautiful in its utility.
  
  What happened to Buffalo is called economic warfare.  <a href="http://alecsatin.com/waterbury-ct-train-station/" rel="nofollow">Heres how it looks in another American city</a>.  Strangely the concept is verboten to be discussed in either the American Left or Right.   How many have the courage to open their eyes and see the devastation worked by "Free trade treaties" rather than bombs?
  
  Some may say the metaphor is no good because there are no dead bodies in the street.  Really?  What do you call methamphetamine, heroin and alcohol deaths and suicides from people who live in towns like Toledo or Erie?  And why does America have the highest percentage of working age men in prison of any other country in the world, including North Korea?  But these things dont easily fit in the acceptable discussion points of liberals, libertarians or conservatives.  Start talking about these things and the conservatives distrust your "socialism" and the liberals close their ears to your "hard right fanaticism".
  
  America is going down because those like George Bush Sr and Bill Clinton and of course Mr Obama are working flat out to bring us into a New World Order which they believe will last a thousand years.  For that to happen, America and Western Europe have to be brought to the same economic level as the rest of the world.  That is, except for a small crust.  There always needs to be a ruling class.
