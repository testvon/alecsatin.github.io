message: 'Oh, how I long for quality products made in USA!  I found a great wool jacket in a store in Two Harbors, MN and it is quality.  Made by Filson, from where Ive purchased other good products (some of their stuff is imported, though, and I havent bought that). http://www.filson.com
  
  I live in sweaters during the winter.  I used to wear sweatshirts, but the dress code at work wouldnt allow that.  I started with some cotton sweaters, but they were foreign made and didnt last long.  I had previously bought a couple heavy wool sweaters made in Scotland to go with my kilt, and my wife had bought me a Norwegian woo sweater as a gift, and I really liked wool much better than cotton.  Somewhere along the line I got on a list for a catalog for Irish stuff and they had an inexpensive ($100) light wool sweater, so I decided to order that to replace a cotton one.  Really nice, so I bought a few more of those Irish-made sweaters for milder weather and then a few more heavy wool Scottish sweaters ($150) for colder weather.  These are sweaters that will be able to be passed to my grandchildren!  Is the price worth it?  When compared to the junky wool or wool blends made in China, you betcha.
  
  We go out of our way to purchase American-made products which are quality-made, regardless of the cost.  They last longer and end up being less expensive overall.  If I have to go outside USA, it will be from countries where the product is quality and the labor not slave.
  
  Oh, and I found "Red Cap" for my slacks.  Good stuff.
  
  Thanks for your link to Rancourt - gives me a new place to shop!'
