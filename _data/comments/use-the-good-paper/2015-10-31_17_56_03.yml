message: 'HI Alec,
  Thank you for sharing this.  It is indeed sad that lack of quality in the goods that we purchase.  We try to buy what will last.  Along the lines of dinnerware, Fiestaware is a find product, made in the USA without lead and virtually indestructible.  Our original purchase which we have used for years has no cracks or chips, none.  That isnt necessarily because I am so careful either.
  We must have been thinking along the same lines.  I wrote something similar last night.  I is a sad commentary on this nation.  God bless you and keep you.  Amen!
