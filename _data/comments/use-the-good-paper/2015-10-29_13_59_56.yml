  Could you send me the name/link to the Irish sweater supplier?  I am needing to replace two light wool sweater vests which are showing obvious wear.  The only lightweight ones Ive been able to find are now made in China.
  
  Since Dockers became so shoddy (not to mention made by indentured serfs) Ive been wearing Dickeys.  No longer made in Fort Worth, USA but of very good quality.  Have never heard of <em>Red Cap</em>.  Will look for them.
  
  Alec'
