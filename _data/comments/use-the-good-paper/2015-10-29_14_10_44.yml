  Its basically saying to use good quality things for your craft and in your life, and to give thanks and gratitude to God for providing such a rich, abundant, beautiful and well-designed world for us to live in and enjoy.  Everything in Gods creation has a purpose and use.  Even in the fallen state, so much good remains.
  
  Using sub-quality items is demonic.  It comes from the evil ones hatred of everything uplifting and good.  A perfectly balanced hammer makes a better world.  A broken space bar on a $2 keyboard in a $1000 Apple laptop which a young person cannot afford to fix or replace confirms them in their idea that the world is crap.
  
  The idea of using the good china is (to me anyway) a little different.  I agree with it.  But Im not sure how many people have "good china" these days.  The very concept of "good china" being available for the average person is almost completely gone.  Its been quietly replaced with the idea of "multiples" and "backups".
  
  Alec'
