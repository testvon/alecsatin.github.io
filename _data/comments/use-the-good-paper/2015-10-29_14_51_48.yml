  They have quite a selection of mens and womens sweaters - and for kids! I bought a couple "girly ones" for my wife also.

  This is the one I have three different colors of (a wee bit more for colors):

  Nice light-weight, with the soft Merino wool.
  My wife bought me this one for Christmas a few years back:

  Heres the link to Red Cap:

  I found the slacks the same time I found that wool jacket in Two Harbors in 2009.  I bought 2 pair because they were on sale, and they have worn very well.
  
  The heavy sweaters you might be interested in (called "jumpers" by the Brits) are made by Brenire.  I have several pull-overs and one cardigan.  The cardigan I got through National Geographic catalog, and afterwards discovered their price was higher than anywhere else, and their shipping was outrageous.  I cant find a site for Brenire though.  This link will at least show you what they look like:

  I have too many :oD, all different colors.  (I got a couple for half price because the British store I shopped at in Dubuque was closing so the owners could retire).'
