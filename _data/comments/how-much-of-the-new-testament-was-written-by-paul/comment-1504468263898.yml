message: "Hi Danielle,\r\n\r\nOrthodox Christians have always considered all the writings of the Old and New Testaments to be of Divine authorship.  The choice of which writings were accepted and which were not was not based on \"domination\" - but on recognition.\r\n\r\nThose who hate Paul are the same ones who reject the first chapters of Genesis.\r\n\r\nMay God continue to lead you into His truth.\r\n\r\nAlec"
