message: "Paul wrote Hebrews, eh?  ;--)  Guess that settles a very long-running debate...\r\n\r\nMore seriously, I appreciate you giving these word counts...I heard someone say that Paul wrote 65% of the NT and that didn't seem right, so I wanted to check and Mr. Google sent me here.  So thanks, and blessings!\r\n\r\nIn Christ,\r\nJeff"
