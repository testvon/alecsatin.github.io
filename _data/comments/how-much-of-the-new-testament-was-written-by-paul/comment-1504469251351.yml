message: "Hi Danielle, \r\n\r\nOrthodox Christians have always considered all the writings of the Old and New Testaments to be of Divine authorship.  The choice of which writings were accepted and which were not was not based on the domination of a human writer - but on recognition of the Divine origin.  The Apostle Paul's writings were accepted because the Christians of the time and of all the centuries since have recognized them as having the quality of authenticity that makes them God's Word.  They are God's Words.  The writings which are of clearly human origin alone were not accepted into the canon and are not part of the Old or New Testaments.\r\n\r\nThe people who hate Paul's writings are the same ones who reject the first chapters of Genesis.\r\n\r\nThe Bible stands or falls as a complete package.  \r\n\r\nMay God continue to lead you into His truth.\r\n\r\nAlec"
