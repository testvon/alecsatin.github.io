  I actually came here to find out about something g I've been struggling with. 
  I take the bible as a whole and not a buffet lunch, but I've been feeling a
  bit down about the domination of the collection of Paul's writings and not so
  much a wider 'variety' of authors.  Please can you help me in any way to know
  how to understand why so many of his writing a were chosen above others
