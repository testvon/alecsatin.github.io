message: 'Thank you for posting this site. How thankful we should be that though we are flesh and blood yet God somehow made us in his image. All of his creation is a reflection of his great power and love.
  Who are we that God is mindful of us? Why should he have such unfathomable love for such a fathomable creature as me. But then again all things are fathomable to him who searches every heart and so easily discerns every element of his creatures.'
