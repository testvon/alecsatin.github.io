message: 'Reading that hurt me.  I love Paul, he is my brother.  The message that God gave him to write to his beloved brethren/Gods beloved children, is such a wonderful message of Gods glorious grace, mercy, and love.
  Since they discount the word that God gave to Paul, they disbelieve all of Gods Word, because God gave Paul supernatural understanding to explain His grace and the work that Jesus Christ did for us on the cross by the very words that God gave him to write.
  All of the Scripture is ultimately about Jesus Christ, His wonderful love and grace to us, and our need of His redeeming love.
  
  And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.  Revelation 19:10
  
  Thank you for sharing this Alec.  Blessings to you through Jesus Christ.  Amen!'
