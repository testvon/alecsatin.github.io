message: 'I miss the Lutheran Church, though Im beginning, after 4 years, to really like my nondenominational.   These hymns are marvelous.  I didnt enjoy playing this at the Lutheran church because theres no time signature on it...For some reason, Lutherans do that a lot :-)
  Since I wasnt raised Lutheran, I had to kind of guess the timing.....
  
  Alec, one of THE thrills of my life was while playing the organ (notice, I didnt say while I was organist..I just played ON it!!) on Pentacost Sunday when the congregation met outside and I sat at the organ waiting for the doors to open and them to enter while I played A MIGHTY FORTRESS IS OUR GOD as LOUDLY AS I POSSIBLY COULD!   BIG PEDALS, EVERYTHING TURNED UP AS HIGH AS pOSIBLE till the WALLS fairly shook..............what a moment....so moving.
  Yes, I miss it.   Long story.
  
  God bless you!'
