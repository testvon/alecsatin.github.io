  (1) You were given the opportunity to defend yourself.  And you did.  Your response <a href="/apostate-christian-comments/#comment-1452" rel="nofollow">was printed and is still there</a>.  Your arguments are also still at <a href="http://birdsoftheair.blogspot.com/2016/02/wrestle-not.html" rel="nofollow">Stans post</a> where you defended them extensively.
  
  You were not given the opportunity to further debate your points here for the reasons stated in this post.
  
  (2a) The history of the Christian Church has been one of ongoing heresies and apostasies.  As new flowerings of false doctrines have appeared, at times of strength Christians have gathered together and countered them with statements.  These are the creeds and confessions.  The Nicene and Apostles Creeds are not enough.
  
  If you read the comments from Don (or Ron) Vega (he uses both names in violation of Jesuss command to let your yea be yea and nay be nay), you can see he believes a heresy which cant be defended from the Lutheran Confessions.  It came from the German Pietistic movement which developed later and is a form of sneaky <a href="/universalist-in-hell/" rel="nofollow">universalism</a> which Vega believes is the true gospel.
  
  If "Justification by faith" is enough to send you to hell, and if "all Confessional Lutherans" believe in Universal Justification (as Vega says) then why do we find this in the Lutheran Confessions (in multiple places and stated in many ways):
  
  <em>This article concerning justification by faith (as the Apology says) is the chief article in the entire Christian doctrine, without which no poor conscience can have any firm consolation, or can truly know the riches of the grace of Christ, as Dr. Luther also has written: If this only article remains pure on the battlefield, the Christian Church also remains pure, and in goodly harmony and without any sects; but if it does not remain pure, it is not possible that any error or fanatical spirit can be resisted. (Tom. 5, Jena, p. 159.) 7] And concerning this article especially Paul says that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. Therefore, in this article he urges with so much zeal and earnestness the particulas exclusivas, that is, the words whereby the works of men are excluded (namely, without Law, without works, by grace [freely], Rom. 3:28; 4:5; Eph. 2:8-9), in order to indicate how highly necessary it is that in this article, aside from [the presentation of] the pure doctrine, the antithesis, that is, all contrary dogmas, be stated separately, exposed, and rejected by this means. -Book of Concord, Solid Declaration, III The righteousness of faith, 6</em>
  
  Notice that its not called the righteousness of all men without their having to believe.  Its called the righteousness of faith.
  
  Many people claim to be Confessional Lutherans yet dont care what the Lutheran Confessions say.  They never read them, quote them, study them, or compare what they say to Scripture for themselves.  The best we can say is that they are lazy and complacent.  The worst we can say (and this is to the professors and teachers) is that they are dishonest.
  
  (2b) You too have written things which show a disagreement with the Reformation confessions in regard to Scripture.  From the Westminster Confession:
  
  <em>IV. The nameity of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed, and obeyed, depends not upon the testimony of any man, or Church; but wholly upon God (who is truth itself) the name thereof: and therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God.
  
  IX. The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture itself: and therefore, when there is a question about the true and full sense of any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it must be searched and known by other places that speak more clearly.
  
  X. The supreme judge by which all controversies of religion are to be determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient writers, doctrines of men, and private spirits, are to be examined, and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Spirit speaking in the Scripture.</em>  -WCF, 1 Of the Holy Scripture
  
  You have written clearly that to you the "words in red" are more important than Christs "words in black".  With this hermeneutic you will come to different conclusions than those of us who are more orthodox (aka Bible-believing) in our interpretation of Scripture.
  
  <strong>The only way Christians can have any discussion or agreement on this blog (or elsewhere) is if they start with the same understanding of what constitutes Scripture and how it is to be interpreted.</strong>
