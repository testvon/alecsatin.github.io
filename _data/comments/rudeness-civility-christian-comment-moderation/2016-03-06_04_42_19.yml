message: 'Hi Ducky,
  Glad you weighed in.  No, I am not the judge of whether you or anyone else is a Christian - thats between you and God.  Luckily hes helped us all by providing what he requires of us in writing in the Bible.  None of us measure up.  Thats the whole reason we need the Savior.
  I wish you well and that is sincerely true. 
  Alec'
