  "Censorship" is what Josh accused me of carrying out here.  Ive also heard this from others.  Moderation is the proper term.  I used censorship to be clear that I am responding to Josh specifically.
  
  The "you have been moderated" method youve laid out makes a lot of sense.  It also takes away any sense of mystery which can happen when posts get completely deleted.
  
  CCCC = Conservative Congregational Christian Conference?  Ive been to one of their churches a few times.  Good people.
  
  Alec'
