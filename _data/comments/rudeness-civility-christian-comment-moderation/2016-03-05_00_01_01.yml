  One. Could you point to the place in the Book of Concord which proves your allegation:
  
  <em>Orthodox Confessional Lutherans (Real Lutherans) believe the Doctrine of Objective Justification.</em>
  
  There are plenty of Orthodox Confessional Lutherans who believe otherwise.  As you know.
  
  Two. Thick skin has to do with the person <em>receiving</em> treatment, not giving it.  Polemics are wonderful.  That is also known as "iron sharpening iron".
  
  What is not okay is venting wrath, trying to destroy a person with ad hominem attacks, and behaving in an un-Christian way.  But you and I do not agree on this point, either.
  
  Three. This is the most wonderful comment of all.  Thank you for adding it!  You hooked me.  Which points would exclude Martin Luther?
  
  Alec'
