message: 'Rule #1  Orthodox Confessional Lutherans (Real Lutherans) believe the Doctrine of Objective Justification.  It is their duty to root out false teachers; especially those who claim to be lutherans that deny this universal precious doctrine.
  
  Rule #2  Real Lutherans must have thick skin.  Why?  Because we are a polemical tribe.  Get used to it.
  
  Irony alert:  By your ground rules, Martin Luther himself would not be allowed to post here.'
