message: 'I concede it is in your purview to moderate your blog however you see fit. My complaint is when I am called out as apostate on your blog post, and not given a chance to defend my side. Especially when I dont believe I have ever posted anything in disagreement with the Apostles Creed, or the Nicene Creed. To be honest I have never read the Book of Concord (I will be reading this), but it is possible my posts may be in contradiction to it. I wonder if you might have an addendum to your rules to offer the accused an avenue to defend themselves.
  
  One last thing. From the perspective of someone that has been moderated. It would be nice to receive some message that acknowledges this. It would also be nice to receive the text of my post back in an email (not sure if this is easy to do). I put a great deal of thought into responses and  the internet has now swallowed a few of them up. I dont always remember to save them. Thanks again for being open to this dialogue.'
