  Ive had to go to moderation because of so much spam and bad behavior.  Here are my comment rules:
  
  I have the following rule posted right at the comment block:
  <i>Comments with links - either with the commenters name or in the text of the comment - which link to sites with heretical, aberrational, obscene or otherwise improper teaching, will not be published with said links. Comments which are mostly, or only, ad hominem attacks will not be published.</i>
  
  I have the following posted under the label “Comment Rules”:
  <i>I have visited too many blogs where comments completely abandon the topic of the article - they get “hijacked” into discussion of many unrelated topics.  I don’t like that and I don’t want to permit that on my blog.  Comments are to be in reference to the article -- or in response to other comments about the article --  or they will not be published.
  
  If the commenter starts out in regards to the article, but then decides to go off on a tangent, then no more comments will be published by that person.
  
  If a commenter wants to discuss something else besides what is in the article, the commenter is more than welcome to e-mail me to engage in a discussion.   If I ask a commenter to take the discussion to email, if he continues trying to post, he will not be published.   The commenter can ask, demand, cajole me into publishing his comments, but it won’t happen so don’t waste your time.
  
  If you disagree with what I say, then demonstrate from Scripture or other data where I am in error and I will be more than willing to recant or correct the error. But if you include any personal attacks against me, your comment will not be posted. I have spent too much time correcting these sorts of comments and challenging commenters to explain the evidence for their personal attacks, and I don’t think it is a proper use of my time. Not only that, but why should I post someone behaving in an un-Christian manner?</i>'
