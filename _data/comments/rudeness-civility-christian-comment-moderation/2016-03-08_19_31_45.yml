message: 'Alec, Im glad to be at your blog and am enjoying what I read and finding agreement.
  
  First: my background was Roman Catholic with a Catholic education. The Lord saved me while I was involved in a Bible study  on Ephesians. This study became a church plant of the Christian Missionary Alliance. During my time in the Alliance, I was sidetracked and injured by Charismania/Word Faith. I almost returned to Catholicism because of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal but my Pastor counseled, warned, and prayed for me.
  
  Reading about Martin Luthers experience (in Baintons bio of him, e.g.), and reading and rereading The Bondage of the Will helped me so much, steadying me as a former Catholic. Because of what we learned through Reformed Christians and Reformation lit, we began attending an Associate Reformed Presbyterian fellowship. When this church closed, we began attending a small independent freewill Baptist fellowship because a friend invited us. We are now Reformed Baptists worshipping there but continuing to adhere to the Solas.
  
  The Lord has steadied and is steadying me. Lately Ive studied primitive Christian groups, which werent part of the Reformation, and I admire these Christians but remain a Protestant - the Protest has not and cannot end. (Rev. 12:11)
  
  Do I have anything to add to the present discussion? Only this, that comments MUST be moderated unless you want confusion, which the Adversary engenders. Also, a blog is our home so to speak. And we cant allow people to come into our home and injure those we love and us. Really, it can harm everyone involved - when we are called to edify one another. For there are an endless number of ways to sin through the spoken and written word, and to stray off the narrow way. As we continue blogging, we learn more about responding and moderating.
  
  Lord bless you, my brother!
  
  Maria'
