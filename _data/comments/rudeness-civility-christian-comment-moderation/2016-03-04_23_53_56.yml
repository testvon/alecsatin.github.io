message: 'Hi Glenn,
  
  My thought on asking a person to reveal their church is to make commenters a little more real and present.  It also provides some kind of framework for some of the theological comments and criticisms which are sometimes raised.
  
  Your rule about links is a good one.  I may add something similar to the new comment guidelines.
  
  And what you wrote here is precisely the point of these two posts this week:
  
  <em>I have spent too much time correcting these sorts of comments and challenging commenters to explain the evidence for their personal attacks, and I donâ€™t think it is a proper use of my time. Not only that, but why should I post someone behaving in an un-Christian manner?</em>
