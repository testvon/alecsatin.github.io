message: 'For one thing you’re using the wrong terminology, it’s not censorship, it’s moderating, and as the blog owner it’s your duty to moderate responses. I used to have open responses on my blog until I pointed out the false teaching of a hypocrite that is loved by the Not All There “Christians”. As a retired Sergeant, I know swearing. I used to be a professional at it. I could “chew you up one side and down the other” for 20 minutes straight while making a pot of coffee and not repeat myself once. But that was then. This is now.
  
  I see my blog as MY blog, and when I saw that foul language on MY blog I began moderating. First, no anonymous posting. You can’t believe how fast baseless bravado can evaporate when the writer is forced to identify himself. Other things I do not tolerate; swearing, insulting people, blasphemy, and going off topic. It’s MY blog, it’s MY heart I’m opening up on MY blog, it’s MY readers I’m trying to protect, it’s OUR savior we’re here to glorify, so we play by MY rules. If someone doesn’t like it they can get their own blog.
  
  I have no problem if someone wants to disagree with me, that’s fine – iron sharpens iron – a disagreement gets my nose down in the bible to reference my assertions. But when someone breaks my rules, especially when they’ve been warned, I will go ahead and post their comments, then respond as to why they are not tolerated and close my comments with <b>“you have been moderated” </b>then I will delete the messages of their posting. All a reader will see is the commenters name, <i>“This comment has been removed by a blog administrator”</i>, and my reason for removing their comments.
  
  Is that harsh? Maybe, but then so is a lot of the language I have had to clean off my blog. And I don’t get a lot of repeat offenders. You know, like Dan T.  So stick to your guns, you have a good set of rules and a great blog. It’s a shame we have to do this but we have readers who don’t want to see that kind of thing.
  
  BTW – the “denomination” of my church is the Four C’s – betcha never saw that before'
