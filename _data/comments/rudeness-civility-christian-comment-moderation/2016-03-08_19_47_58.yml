message: 'Hi Maria,
  
  Thank you for your comment.  I found myself nodding in agreement while reading.  Long ago I was in training to be a minister in the Reformed Episcopal Church when that denomination "merged" in some way with the Christian and Missionary Alliance.  I knew so little at the time that I could not make sense of what was happening.  I left the seminary, then the denomination and eventually my faith for 20 some years.  Fortunately God never let go of me.
  
  Thank you for confirming what I believe - that these blogs are something like online living rooms.  When you make a comment its very much like being a guest in someones home.  Its just good manners to behave respectfully.  Of course, it seems that some people have never learned basic manners.  Or maybe they dont care - I dont know.  But the majority of people who come around here for "a cuppa tea and a sit down" are wonderful folks.  I only wish we were able to have these conversations face to face.
  
  Alec'
