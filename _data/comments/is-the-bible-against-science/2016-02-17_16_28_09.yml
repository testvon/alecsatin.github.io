message: 'Hi Josh,
  
  If you believe that the Bible is true in all points, then you start from a position of belief rather than doubt.  I challenge you to read the first 11 chapters of Genesis in the KJV or another literal translation in an attitude of prayer and humility.  Dont bring your understanding of how the universe was created to the Bible.  Be an open book while you read and let the Holy Spirit guide you into all truth.
  
  If you are under 50 years old, then you have been systematically conditioned all through your education to believe in the unscientific theory of evolution.  Be willing to check things out for yourself as a real scientist.
  
  In regard to the questions you ask:
  
  In terms of dinosaurs:
  Start here: https://answersingenesis.org/dinosaurs/
  
  In terms of the apparent age of the earth:
  Start here: https://answersingenesis.org/age-of-the-earth/
  
  This blog is not a place to debate this subject.  I stand with Christians and Jews through thousands of years of history who have trusted God when he tells us that he created the earth from nothing in 6 literal days.
  
  May God lead you into all truth.
  In Christ,
  Alec'
