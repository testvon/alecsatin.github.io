message: "I've read a lot of sci-fi that revolves around a prophesied redeemer, \r\nand to me it is starting to look like the author of these stories is trying to undermine Jesus and His ministry rather than support it. Ripping off Jesus is a cheap and easy way to successful fantasy because the world knows that Jesus came to save us. The world replies\r\n- So did Neo, and he could fly and dodge bullets.\r\n- So did Muad'Dib, and he could ride sand worms\r\n- So did Conan, and he became emperor\r\n- So did Frodo, and he had a ring of invisibility \r\n- So did Muhammed, and he had a 9 year old wife"
