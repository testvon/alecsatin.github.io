message: 'I knew that angels are created beings and not to be worshiped, but never considered when they where created. Ill try to be a good Berean and ponder on it further with the Holy Scriptures. Its good to know these things. In 2012, the night before my last surgery, I had a near death experience where I almost crossed over. My heart stopped, but before I completed my journey to eternity, an angel pulled me back to the living. The only thing I remember about the angel is that he was <i>very</i> bright. (They dont have wings either but the rays of light must have been mistaken for wings in ancient artwork.) Also, didnt hear or speak to anyone as I approached my LORD but I must say that what I took back from it is we will all be happily surprised at how much Jesus loves us. HE is pure love and everything we will ever need or want forever. ~:)'
