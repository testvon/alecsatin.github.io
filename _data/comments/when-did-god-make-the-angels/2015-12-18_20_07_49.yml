message: 'Its unclear whether it was on day 2 or day three but the idea that the creation of angels may have predated the creation of the world is, in my opinion, false.  Two scripture references prove to be conclusive enough for me.  First, Genesis 1:1 "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."  In this verse we see the creation of time (the beginning), space (the heavens), and matter (the earth). There couldnt have been time before God created time.  God is apart from time; He is eternal.  The next verse I reference is in the Decalog (Exodus 20:11  "For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and ALL that is in them..."  Since angels are created beings, they are part of the ALL that occupy time and space, therefore they had to have been created after the beginning and prior to the completion of creation on day six.'
