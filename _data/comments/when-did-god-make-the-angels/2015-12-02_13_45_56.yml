  Perhaps youre right. 
  <br />
  I like what Matthew Poole says about Genesis 1.1:
  <br />
  <em><strong>In the beginning</strong>, to wit, of time and things, in the first place, before things were distinguished and perfected in manner hereafter expressed.</em>
  <br />
  Before time and things.  If there was anything before that, God would have told us.  Since He did not, we are on solid ground basing our reasoning on what has been revealed.  So the idea that there were previous universes before this one is myth.  The only creatures created in the image of God are human, placed in the garden of whose descendants we are.
  <br />
  At least thats how I understand it.  Could I be wrong?  Sure.  1 Corinthians 13.12
  <br />
  Always glad for your perspective.
  Alec'
