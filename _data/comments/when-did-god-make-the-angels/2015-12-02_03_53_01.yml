message: 'You might be jumping to a conclusion.
  In the beginning would be the beginning of our universe or such.
  We know God predated Genesis, so its conceivable the angels as a creation predated our "environment".
  Also Ps 104, if chronological, may not be,:
  4 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:
  5 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.
  
  Of course, that follows :
  3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:
  
  Its a good discussion, but I dont think conclusive.'
