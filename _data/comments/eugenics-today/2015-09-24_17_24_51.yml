You have almost stated how deeply seated the hatred is.
  
  Heres a short peek.
  
  In the enemys camp are people who are have been convinced through indoctrinating propaganda that they enemys view is inevitable, and so they go along as true believers.
  
  For those who have faith that G_d will always provide for his creatures, they have a major battle on their hands, because you will be largely battling people whose moral code is selflessly based (saving humanity from itself) but without your faith. The ancient Sophists called them casuists. The deliberate pattern of exploiting well-intentioned people for nefarious gain is as at least as old as the time of Socrates who fought them and lost. So they enemy has had long practice at this game.
  
  Who can be saved and who must be fought and how to do it is the question the faithful must face. I do know that it is a sin -- falling far short of our commitments -- to allow the lies to accumulate and manifest into the megalomaniac forces that are getting ever stronger.
