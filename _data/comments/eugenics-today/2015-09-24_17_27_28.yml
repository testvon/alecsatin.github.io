message: 'Who can be saved and who must be fought and how to do it is the question the faithful must face. I do know that it is a sin -- falling far short of our commitments -- to allow the lies to accumulate and manifest into the megalomaniac forces that are getting ever stronger. Yet large numbers of the faithful still turn their backs on the information you have reported today and against which I and others have fought for decades.
  
  How deeply embedded is the enemy?
  
  A statement that Pope Francis made in Bolivia in July, hideous in its denial of three types of mayhem and murder now afoot globally, is now being exploited by Bernie Sanders in an advertisement. It touches a subject that Ive been laying out since the 
  Planned Parenthood videos first surfaced. The Lord give me strength, I hope to complete it later today.'
