  My friend Pascal has been railing about the "Sustainability" Death Corp for years.
  Pascal Fervor
  Despite the alleged separation of church and state, BELIEF in Sustainability is widely held in American secular government. Judeo-Christian moral guidelines have been incrementally supplanted by what can best be described as neo-pagan ones. Consequently, notice where rulers never utter a harsh word towards Malthusian, Utilitarian and Green nutcases. There the ruled are at grave risk.'
