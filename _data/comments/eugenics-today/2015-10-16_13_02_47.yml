  The more we look around, the more we see these open statements all around us.  Good find.
  
  Many of the people who follow along with these "earthling" type of ideas truly think they are following a moral chain of thought.  In a sense they are.  But its a morality completely cut off from the source of all truth, which is God, who has revealed right and wrong in the Bible.
  
  The "earthling" type morality is based on evolutionary thought, and is at its core anti-human and anti-God.  Does this sound just a little Luciferian to you?'
