  Im just hoping there is no fall of Christianity quite yet.  We have a new bunch, about 80, of Campus Crusade for Christ (now called CRU) coming to our church this summer...handsome, bright young people with the occasional unrestrained hand that flies into the air during worship...talk about invigorating!  So good to see.'
