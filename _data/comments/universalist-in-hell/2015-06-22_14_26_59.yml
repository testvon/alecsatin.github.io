message: 'Which came first? The fall of Christianity into the abyss of Universalism? Or,  America, with its acceptance of "multiculturalism?" Or, did the 2 "isms" contaminate each other?
  
  Error-wise, I find the aforementioned 2 "isms" parallel. Because these two widely embraced thought systems teach a way of life which eschew Creator / Savior, Christ and His Divine Revelation, The Holy Scriptures.
  
  Nothing could be more antithetical to Disciples of Christ than the decadent cultures false religion of "all value systems are equal."'
