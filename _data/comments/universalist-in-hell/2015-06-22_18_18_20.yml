  Do you think singing them at all is disrespectful?  Maybe Im just missing something....I just now read over your account and now Im getting they sang them jauntily without the feeling they should have shown. If thats the case, Im totally with you.
  
  I was thinking the other day about that song from FROZEN that every single little kid across this land (and the world) sings called LET IT GO.  I cant help thinking how many children today know the quintessential song taught all little children years ago, JESUS LOVES ME....if as many knew that as LET IT GO, what a different world we might have!
  
  Thanks...'
