  The original name for the Unitarian Church was/is the "Unitarian Universalist Church".  The joke used to be they are 1/3 former-protestant, 1/3 former-Catholic and 1/3 former Jewish.  Hadnt heard your line, but agree it fits.  Theyre okay with God, just not the God of the Bible.
  
  The issue with the singers was not that they were singing patriotic songs, but the manner and context in which they were singing.  The best analogy I can give is from the Book of Acts:
  
  <blockquote>And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying: 17 The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation. 18 And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour. -Acts 16.16-18</blockquote>
  
  So here were the first Christians, preaching around the world.  A woman started following them saying to everyone that they were servants of the most high God, showing the way of salvation.  Sounds true and good, right?  But the apostle Paul was <strong>grieved</strong> by her.   Why?
  
  Sometimes its wholesome to hear things from people who dont believe them or know what theyre saying.  But other times good things spoken in the wrong way are a mockery.  Sometimes sarcasm is like this.  But those who disgrace heroes arent always sarcastic.
  
  In the Battle Hymn of the Republic (Glory Glory Hallelluia) one verse reads this way:
  
  <blockquote>
    He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
    He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;
    Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet;
    Our God is marching on.
    Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
    Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Our God is marching on.
  </blockquote>
  
  Part of the popularity of this song from 1861 was the searing memory in the American spirit of all the men killed in the Civil War, 620,000 men.  Related to todays US population, that would be the same as 6 million American soldiers dead.
  
  These street-corner "patriots" had no idea whatsoever what they were singing.  They were <em>irreverent</em>.  They had no respect to those 620,000 dead men.  It was a big jolly game to them.  It was as if they were singing something from Barney.  Maybe this seems like nit-picking to some.  Sorry if thats the case.  But there have been heroes in this country.  And they deserve to be respected, or they should not be mentioned at all.
  
  Im more than willing to have my opinion changed if Im wrong on this. 
  Alec'
