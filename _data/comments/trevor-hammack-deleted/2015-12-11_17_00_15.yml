message: 'Hi Roberta,
  
  When Trevors voice was silenced, the Christian world lost a vital source of honest news reporting.  Thats the bottom line.  Whether he was blackmailed, or he chose to silence himself the loss is real.  I only hope if he is monitoring this conversation that he finds a way to resume his news reporting.
  
  Of course that assumes he is free to do so.  Silence implies the blackmail or pressure against him is real.  I have no evidence for this - just my opinion.  Take it for what it is.
  
  He has a gift which has been taken away from the church.  That is a terrible sin against the people of God.'
