  I had a long conversation with my friend after letting to many years go by with out reaching out to him.  Its unfortunate how he was taken advantage of and then attempted to be blackmailed.  While he takes full responsibility for his actions (merely just failing to recognize online advances on him, and to nip them in the bud), he was trolled by a female individual who maintained every piece of communication between them for nearly 5 or so years. Then once Trevor recognized how things were beginning to turn bad he CUT HER OUT!  She threatened him, then followed through on that threat.  There is so much to this situation that played out, and how everything points to pre-meditation to ruin his life personally and professionally, that its too much to go into here.  Im just disappointed in the online "communitys" accusations and gossip.  I know Trevor didnt really provide a sort of "closure" to his online followers, but with all due respect, he really didnt have to.  When things went south and he saw where it was going, he removed the "avenue", from which this devastation entered his life, immediately to show his commitment to ending the situation.  Then he stayed away from most, if not all, online interaction....I dont blame him.  That is why nothing has been said about it online...hes not online....and I dont know when he ever will be.'
