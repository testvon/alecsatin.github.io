message: 'A good number of stone-throwers in these comments feel a need to focus on the sins of Trevor Hammack rather than the real point of the post, which is the elimination of independent news sources from the internet.
  
  If Pastor Hammack committed adultery, then we would hope he would repent and take appropriate action.  Thats a matter between him and the people involved, including his congregation.  It is an important but separate issue from the internet-scrubbed News in Focus programs, which have now all been destroyed.
  
  Not many of the self-righteous "drive by commentators" seem to care a whit about the narrowing control of information through the multi-national news cartel system.
  
  Without a fourth estate, freedom is impossible.
  
  People like Trevor Hammack are a real threat.  Well, they were.'
