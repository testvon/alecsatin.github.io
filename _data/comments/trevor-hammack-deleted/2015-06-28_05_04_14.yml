message: 'Just wondering...what makes you think he didnt just fall into sin and had to resign like every unofficial account Ive heard?
  
  I was a fan and still am of his sermons and hate that we dont have acess to them anymore but if anything was untrue in the accusations leveled against him, dont you think people in his congregation would have jumped to his defense?
  
  I do wish he would come forward and answer for some of the things that happened and why. Otherwise there will be alot of filling in the blanks.'
