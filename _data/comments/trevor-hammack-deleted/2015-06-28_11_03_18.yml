  Thanks for stopping by.
  
  Religious men fall into sin, and always have.  Think David and Bathsheba.  Or Aaron and the golden calf (Exodus 32).  Or Mark Driscoll and stealing.  But ask yourself, when was the last time a pastors life work was expunged from the public record?  Thats the mystery here.
