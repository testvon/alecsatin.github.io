message: 'I am a past friend of trevors, we were very close, studied religiouly,  and lived with him for about 2years in the early 90s.  I made some terrible decisions in relationships, turned back to alcohol and I have been on and off the path ever since.   I have been moved recently to search him out and finally have, and am very proud of his ministry and I would have been a part of that.   I have been in the wilderness for 20 some years, but now for the first time in awhile I can truly see Gods hand moving me in a direction, but not sure where yet, and letting go of those besetting sins once and for all.   Trevor was the first person to come to mind, we took those harold camping classes together.   While we didnt agree with alot of it, we figured we could use them as types, but n0t actual interpretation.   Anyhow I am just trying to reconnect and just find my place in the body of christ again.   I can be contacted by email ... and phone ... .
