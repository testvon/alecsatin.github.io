  What can the righteous do? [Psalm 11:3]
  
  The righteous can witness Almighty Creator / Savior God at work:
  
  The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORDS throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup. For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright. - Psalm 11:4-7 - KJV'
