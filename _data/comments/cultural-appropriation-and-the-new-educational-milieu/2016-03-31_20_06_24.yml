  Yes, this could be staged.   Its hard to tell these days what is and is not real.
  
  Excellent example of the underlying attitude.  Its ideological warfare pure and simple.   Too bad Americans couldnt care less about Twentieth-Century Chinese and Russian history.
  
  Thanks for your comments, Ducky. 
  Alec'
