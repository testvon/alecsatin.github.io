  Myself, Ive about had it with social justice warriors since they recently invaded the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.
  Its a great story, The museum organized a program around the return of Monets <i> La Japonaise </i> after a loan to the Kyoto museum of art and some restoration work.
  To celebrate the re-hanging of a foundation work in the museums collection patrons were invited to try on a kimono similar to the one in the painting and supplied to the museum by the Japanese consulate which cosponsored the promotion.
  Several local Japanese school teachers brought their class on a field trip. The whole thing was a hit until the SJWs showed up.
  
  At that point a handful (7 max) of folks showed up protesting cultural appropriation (which, ironically, the painting may be commenting on) and handing a list of demands to the museum.
  I though it was odd that not a single protestor was Japanese so the issue of Chinese/Japanese appropriation was off the table. I guess all Asians have the same culture.
  
  So they make the usual demands, an apology and a voice in curating the museums Asian collection (the finest in America).
  
  The museum stopped the promotion early and hosted a panel discussion with the dweebs.
  For myself, I can state that everyone, left and right, is losing patience with these jerks. I do believe this movement is about to fizzle out because it is taking the oxygen away from discussions of real issues.
  
  But I do feel this bizarre incident at SFSU was staged.
  Im also curious if her friend is British. If not, how does he come off wearing a trench coat?'
