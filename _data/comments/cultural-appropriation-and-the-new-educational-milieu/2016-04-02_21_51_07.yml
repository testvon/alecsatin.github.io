message: 'It is nonsense.  But whether this was staged or not, the whineries nationwide are churning out hundreds of thousands of indoctrinated robots who will soon be making civic and state laws on matters of feelings.  I actually heard what sounded like a sensible young man explain how maybe he could be wrong on something since he was a white privileged male.  And his name wasnt Rockefeller.   Sad.'
