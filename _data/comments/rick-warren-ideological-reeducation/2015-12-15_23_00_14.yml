  The goal moving into 2016 is to <em>strengthen faith in the Son of God</em> and help readers like yourself to <em>stand strong in the face of cunning craftiness by intentional deceivers (Ephesians 4.11-14)</em>.
  
  The important thing now for all of us is to grow closer to our Lord.  For we are closer to that day than when we first believed (Romans 13.11).  These are wonderful, glorious times.  The enemy wants us to be in fear and hopelessness.  But truly, if God be for us, who can stand against us? (Romans 8.31)  We are wise to the plans and designs of evil men.  By shedding light on them, we will be better prepared to be clear lights to those around us.  And if God wills, perhaps we can all snatch some lost ones from the fire.  The time is short.
  
  Be blessed.
  Alec'
