message: 'Dear Abigail,
  
  I appreciate your passion.  Yet seeking to silence—even if it means crushing—differing views of identity is the work of an oppressor.  You may say that those who differ with you should be crushed, because they posit a worldview that sees identity differently, and denies yours.
  
  I would like to say that we go to the trouble of bringing up these differences for love of you, as denying the identities our Creator gave each of us humans and preferring our own will end up terribly badly in the life to come, after the resurrection and judgment.  We are told by the merciful God, and His Son Jesus Christ, to tell you of these things so you may not be unwarned or unprepared.
  
  We are born female and male.  Some folks do not like that and seek to change the identities that were assigned to them at birth.  Okay, in this life you have the freedom to do that, but in the life to come we will all have to answer to our Creator God for our violations of, and rebellions against, His law—His designs for holy living and flourishing in His creation.  None of us keep His laws perfectly, and He has provided forgiveness for all lawbreakers and rebels through the loving sacrifice of His Son Jesus Christ, who bore the punishment for our sins so we would not have to bear it throughout eternity.
  
  You may violently react to what I have said, and desire to silence me by whatever means you can, but the bottom line is that you must be warned of the issues involved, and of a loving God who will forgive all rebellion and transgression against Him and His laws of life and of love.
  
  We will not be silenced, as the love of God constrains us to speak.  You may call what we are about “hate”—but in reality what would be “hate” would be to keep silent about the awful danger you will face in the world to come.
  
  For the love of Christ we speak, and for the love of you we do not remain silent.  We have been doing this for over twenty centuries, bearing witness to the truth—and we shall till the end of the age.
  
  Steve R'
