   Stop it right now. 
  Seriously stop it.
  
  You have no idea how much work must be done to first accept, embrace, and then share ones identity as LGBTQIA. And your refusal to see this person as Gay is a horrible thing.
  
  Its not your identity to embrace or reject and your rejection of it is doing active harm.'
