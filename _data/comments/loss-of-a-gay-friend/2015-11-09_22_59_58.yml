message: 'So sorry to hear that your friend is still choosing the world with temporary acceptance over eternal joy. I, too, have lost friends because of my choice to follow Christ. Its not just the homosexuals that have trouble with our choices. Its also adulterers, thieves, lying of any kind, hate, general unkindness, etc. etc. It makes those not trying to live right feel really uncomfortable to be anywhere near anyone who is trying to live correctly. 
  Thats a good observation that we also represent Gods Law. Hadnt thought of that. I think more of myself as a mirror that reflects Christ and His goodness but of course, God is also wrath (the law). Anyway, I pray that your friend will have more people witness to her that she may be saved. Im so grateful no one gave up on me.
  Hope your day is blessed. ~:)'
