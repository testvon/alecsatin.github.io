message: 'Compassionately and precisely stated, Alec. This line is classic with regard to telling others of our desperate need for a Saviour:  "I become the law of God, hated because it awakens the knowledge of sin." It remains that this knowledge is a great gift from God, warning us of our danger, and our need. It is in His compassion that He gives us this, and yours, that you risk reproach for passing it on to your dear friends.'
