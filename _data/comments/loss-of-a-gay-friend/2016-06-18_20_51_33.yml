message: 'Dear Abigail,
  
  You seem to be a person of good will.
  
  If you were to read the horrible things people from Ravelry have written me and said they would like to do to me, I hope you would be as disturbed as I have been.  
  
  I have never wished any harm on any gay person, nor ever will I.
  
  As a Confessional Lutheran, I believe the Bible to be the word of God.  That word says that all human beings are sinners before him. We all need Jesus to be made right with God.
  
  I am sorry that the truth of my situation is experienced by you as active harm.  The real harm comes from hating people of different tribes.  Theres an awful lot of hate being directed at me by people who claim the label "tolerant".  Thank you for not doing that.
  
  With kindness and respect to you on your journey,
  Alec Satin'
