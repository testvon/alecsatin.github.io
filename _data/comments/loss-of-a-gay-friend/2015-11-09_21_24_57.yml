message: 'Have you ever seen the documentary, <em>The Kinsey Syndrome</em>?  Its available to watch free online <a href="https://youtu.be/j9ztmp1yDq8" rel="nofollow">here</a> or can be purchased from Adullamfilms.com .  It goes a long way to explain how our society (and the world) has become so obsessed with sexuality.  From the description:
  
  <blockquote>
    We are releasing a new edition of our controversial film, "The Kinsey Syndrome" with a new cover design. We are very pleased to relate the this work continues to be used as a tool to warn of the damaging influence of Alfred C. Kinsey and his impact on the sexual revolution, pornography, abortion, and all the wicked fruit of the ungodly descent into immorality that our nation has suffered since the Kinsey Reports were first issued in 1948.
    
    As the documentary so masterfully illustrates, there is a pre-Kinsey and a post-Kinsey America. Unfortunately, we live in the latter. All our major elitist institutions: the courts; the media; academia; the entertainment industry and others -- have relied upon Kinseys wholly discredited research to move America away from adherence to the Judeo-Christian sexual ethic, and toward a secular-humanist, morally relative worldview. The Kinsey Syndrome has helped to expose Alfred Kinsey and his lifes work as pure fraud."
