message: 'Its amazing how many "Christians" want to claim Jesus is God, that he was sinless, etc, and yet they dont want to accept his statements about the O.T. as factual evidence for the O.T., especially Genesis.  Cafeteria Christians -- they pick and choose what they want to accept based on their personal biases.'
