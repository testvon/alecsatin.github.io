message: 'By the way, Alec...along the lines of this article, my church met at another church yesterday as theres merger being considered.  This churchs average age of congregant is probably 28?   Ours is probably 45.... 
  Ive been excited about the merger but holding my excitement until I heard a sermon from the other pastor in person.
  Brother, was I surprised...a man of approx 35?....and marvelous.  He spoke of how we in West Los ANgeles are similar to the church in Acts....but those people Paul said to go out to and share the Gospel with were at least believers in A GOD...a higher power...at least they had values of old traditions, etc etc.
  TODAY, its quite another story, quite a bit more difficult........He said more and much, much more eloquently, but I was hooked on his thinking.
  I can email you a link if youre interested and have time...no prob if you dont, of course.  let me know.
  
  SO, all that to say that not only was that message important and is relevant to your post subject, BUT to be with about 100 young folks who absolutely LOVE JESUS and want to spread the word was exhilarating...absolutey exhilarating.  Im now hoping we definitely merge.  They even do communion every week, as we do, AND he made no bones that This is the blood and body of Jesus.....eat and drink in memory of me....
  very unusual, and very beautiful stuff.'
