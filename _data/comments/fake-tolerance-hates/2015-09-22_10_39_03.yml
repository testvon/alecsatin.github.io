message: 'God bless you for being out there - you know my thoughts on FB.  It breaks my heart to see my countrymen and young people willingly and openly offering themselves upon this altar to be manipulated and experimented on like brute beasts.
  
  <em>So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper [in the thing] whereto I sent it. -Isaiah 55.11</em>
  
  Keep speaking Scripture to them, Ed.
