message: 'This is what happens to the mass of people - the next generation - when they are fed only (a) Christian religiosity (e.g. Christian left, social gospel, and the church growth movement) and (b) Mystery Schools Religion (e.g. New Age, reincarnation, word of faith, spiritual formation, etc).  The children are left with, "Ill do what I can to be a good person and hope for the best."'
