message: 'Its the old but true nature abhors a vacuum saying. They took God out of the schools, the government, the TV, most Churches, and the devil took over. Its no wonder the young are lost since all their role models now are crooked politicians, wicked government, lazy parents, the unchecked TV viewing, technology (the new drug), overpaid teachers and sports figures, and so forth. Most Churches arent even scripturally sound. So many of the young dont even know who Jesus Christ is today. Thats sad and tragic. Our English language is dying too. If I hear "like" out of context one more time ... <em>heavy sigh</em>
  Keep looking up and hope you have a blessed day.'
