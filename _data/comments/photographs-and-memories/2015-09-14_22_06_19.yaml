  A collection of photos has passed down and come to me and I hope
  there is someone to care about them when I go. Its long past time that the
  people pictured can be identified and the collection almost acts as a mini history of the Merrimack valley in Massachusetts.
  
  So we just retain a record of our part in the human comedy.
  
  Whos the little girl on the steps waving the American flag?
  The two old women sitting at the base of a monument?
  I know its my grandfather in front of that shoe stitching machine.
  What about the old Wright style biplane.
  
  I find something comforting in them all fading back in t the collective and thats
  a sentiment you might reject and I can understand that but if I were you I
  would give long consideration to being the one who keeps those photos, sorts them and has a few framed.
  
  Might be some of Joran. You cared enough to go to his funeral.'
