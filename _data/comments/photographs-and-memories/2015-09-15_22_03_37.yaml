message: 'Beautiful post, Alec, thanks.  My home is filled with framed pictures of loved ones, here and gone already, almost too many of them, probably, but theyre staying....its a connection to the past and their faces are still loved.
  They were all believers;  I hope to see them again.  Particularly my husband, of course.'
