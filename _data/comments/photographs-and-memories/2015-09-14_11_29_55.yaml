message: 'So deeply moved and touched by your story.  Life is hard and The Lords ways are hard to understand.  I hope that there is mercy in that time between life and death and revelation is given.  After all the disciples were slow to understand Jesus and they were with Him.  Thanks for sharing and your wisdom.  Vivien, UK.'
