message: 'That is so cute.  I have a poor pathetic little white kitty who sadly lost his right hind leg to an animal attack (his foot was dislocated off his right hind leg and the vet amputated), there are times he gets so itchy on that side of his neck and head that he comes to me begging to be scratched (when I ask him if hes itchy he meows even louder).  I know I have been successful in alleviating the itch when he starts purring, other times he swipes at me with his front paw as if to say to I missed it.  He is so funny and so pathetic, but I love him lots.'
