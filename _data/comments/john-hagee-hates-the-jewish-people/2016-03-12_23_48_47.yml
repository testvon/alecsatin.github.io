message: 'That whole "Four Blood Moon" fiasco didnt clue the world in on John Hagee? I just stumbled across an article on John Hagee by Prof Johan Malan who reiterated Hagees statements on Israel, then went on to talk about more misconceptions Hagee is spreading about Jesus:
  
  <i>Another concern about John Hagee is his promotion of the prosperity gospel. He regards poverty as a curse and says that the Lord Jesus has delivered us from poverty on the cross and gave us the riches of Abraham. He shamelessly twists the Gospel account to depict Jesus in earthly terms as a rich man. He says: “Jesus was not poor… Jesus had a nice house! John 1:38-39 says that Jesus turned to those that were following Him and said, Come with Me. And they said, Where dwellest Thou? He said, Come and see. And Jesus took that whole crowd home with Him to stay in His house. That meant it was a big house. Jesus wore fine clothes. John 19:23 says that He had a seamless robe. Roman soldiers gambled for it at the foot of the cross. It was a designer original. It was valuable enough for them to want it… Poverty is caused by sin and disobeying the Word of God… Poverty is a curse.”</i>
  
  To me he sounds like a Joel Osteen who actually opened the bible... once.'
