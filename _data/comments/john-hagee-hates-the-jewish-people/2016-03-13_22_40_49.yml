  And here is a quote of Hagee from the Houston Chronicle (edit 2016-05-18 no longer available at the Houston Chronicle Website.  Original Title "san-antonio-fundamentalist-battles-anti-semitism.html" )
  
  <em>"Im not trying to convert the Jewish people to the Christian faith," he said. "There is nothing in the `night to honor Israel that does that." In fact, trying to convert Jews is a "waste of time," he said. "The Jewish person who has his roots in Judaism is not going to convert to Christianity. There is no form of Christian evangelism that has failed so miserably as evangelizing the Jewish people. They (already) have a faith structure." Everyone else, whether Buddhist or Bahai, needs to believe in Jesus, he says. But not Jews. Jews already have a covenant with God that has never been replaced by Christianity, he says.
