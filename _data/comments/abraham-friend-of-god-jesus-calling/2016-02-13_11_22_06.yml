message: 'Excellent post, Alec. You raise important points, often forgotten.
  
  Catholics and Protestants alike hold that Abraham is our father in faith. Doing a search on those words alone shows many denominations affirming it.
  
  Abraham our father in faith and Abraham and his seed are part of some Eucharistic/consecration and funeral prayers in the Catholic and Anglican rites, respectively. There are no doubt examples in other denominations prayers used for public worship.'
