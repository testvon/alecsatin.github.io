message: 'Insightful, and helps me understand whats "wrong" with <i>Jesus Calling</i>. Excellent outline on Abraham.  Part of the type that the near sacrifice of Isaac makes is <i>the obedience of the son to the fathers will.</i>.  So the commentary that "Isaac suffered terribly" is misleading.  He MAY have suffered, as did Jesus, but NOT because his father had undisciplined emotions.  Geesh!
  
  More than one friend (solid Christians) have recommended this to me as a devotion.  Its a mainstay in one ladys devotions with her husband, and she and I are very much on the same parallel.  Yet I could <i>not</i> get into this book.  It seemed off and straining to make points.  So I set it aside long ago.  I find Ruth Myers <i>A Treasury of Praise</i><i> much more useful.  Shows how we have to always be vigilant and be like the Bereans - hear good news then go check it out against what the bible says.
  
  Although I do believe we can make idols of many good things, including family, when we put them above God in our level of trust and confidence.</i>'
