message: 'Hi Baysider.  The evident inability many supposed Christians have in being able to distinguish between the voice of our Lord and the speaker in (false) <em>Jesus Calling</em> is extremely troubling to all of us.  Thank God you could tell the book was <em>off</em>.  It is <em>off</em>.  Its demonic.  I dont know why people who seem to be solid cant see this.  They defend their celebrity idols with teeth and claw.  All we are called to do is warn.  If they dont want to hear, what can we do?
  
  But the danger to us is to buy into the spirit of the age which says that, <em>conflict over religious doctrine is unloving</em>.  No.  The most loving thing we can do as true Christians is to love by pointing out serious problems.  Like (false) <em>Jesus calling</em>.
  
  Thank you as always for your insights, Baysider.
  
  Alec'
