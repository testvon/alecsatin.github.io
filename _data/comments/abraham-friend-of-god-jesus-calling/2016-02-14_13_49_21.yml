message: 'Thank you Churchmouse for these examples.  Its outrageous that so called Christians could believe that Abraham was a mess of a man.  Another indication of how too many of us are just like the world in preferring our electronic toys and entertainment to spending time just reading the Word of God.
  
  If a person doesnt know the Word, how can they tell when someone is pulling the wool over their eyes?  And there are a lot of pseudo-Christian wool pullers about.
