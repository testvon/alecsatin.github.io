message: 'Yes Glenn.  Maybe they are consciously aware of their anti-Semitism, and maybe not.  Probably many are.  And there are how many others that dont want to hurt the feelings of Jewish people by speaking to them of the Christian faith.  It makes little difference.  The net result is the same.  Bible Christians are silent.  Jews go to hell.'
