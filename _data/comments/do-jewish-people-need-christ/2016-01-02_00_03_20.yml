  Its important to rightly divide the Word of truth concerning the Jews. During this dispensation of grace, all people need our LORD Jesus Christ to be saved. There are no special peoples or exceptions. 
  Ive been terribly lax about using hymns as praise of late. Thank you for that reminder.
  Hope your day is blessed.'
