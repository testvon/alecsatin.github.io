  Gospel of Thomas, huh?  Somehow that one didnt make it into the real Bible.  Im sure that Lutheran pastor worked hard to learn his apostasy in seminary.  Most all of the Lutheran (and other mainstream denominational) seminaries have been moderate to liberal leaning for decades.
  
  If the list reads like a "Christian" left playbook, thats because the so-called Christian left is nothing more than the old apostate Liberalism in trendy garb.  But you knew that already!
