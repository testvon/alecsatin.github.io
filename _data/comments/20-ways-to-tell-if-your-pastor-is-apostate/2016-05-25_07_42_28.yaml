message: 'Rejection of the preservation and inerrancy of Scripture should be part of that list.  If they dont believe we have extant the infallible, inerrant, inspired, preserved Word of God in our hands today, then they can preach from whatever is to their fancy, such as the Gospel of Thomas.  Liberals, of course, have led the way in textual criticism which has dethroned the Word of God from its high and lofty place within the church and delivered into the hands of scholars.  What a tragedy!'
