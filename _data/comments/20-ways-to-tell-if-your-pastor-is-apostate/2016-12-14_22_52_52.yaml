message: 'I found the list to be edifying - it is very difficult to find a congregation that doesnt have an apostate Pastor at its helm. I am thankful for the internet because it allows me to attend an orthodox congregation and put my flesh into subjection of Gods law to avoid heterodox teachers because there are no orthodox Pastors in my area in a "Lutheran" community. Many laity struggle with this in my opinion.
  
  I also agree with the inerrancy issue as being a mark of apostasy.
  
  In Christ,
  Glen Kotten'
