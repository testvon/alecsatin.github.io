  We forget that we are in a battle, but not alone.  We have Christ before us, and brothers and sisters all around, fellow-soldiers.  The <a href="http://alecsatin.com/good-hope-for-all-the-saints/" rel="nofollow">hymn for Sunday</a> includes this stanza:
  
  <em>  And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long,
    Steals on the ear the distant triumph song,
    And hearts are brave, again, and arms are strong.
    Alleluia, Alleluia!
  </em>
  
  The war is already over, but for us in time, it still rages, for a little while.
