message: 'Yes, you are correct.  Near-death is not death.  The only way we can know what hell or heaven are like comes to us through the words of Scripture.
  
  Sometimes people lie about heaven and hell experiences, and other times they are deceived.  In any case, they quite often go astray and lead others with them.
  
  Hell is for real.  Whatever it may be like, I hope no one reading these words will ever experience it.
  
  Thanks as always for your clarity.'
