message: 'I know that everyone experiences a dream where they are falling.  I’ve been told that those who wake up during the fall are saved from a likely heart attack in the middle of the night.  Who knows?  Equally, we know nothing at all about death beyond the fact that it is final on this earth.  Our faith tells us about things beyond the grave.  Part of this faith, I believe, is our hope that it is true.  This is very typically human behavior, for even the most barbaric humans on earth believed in an after-life.  We cannot reconcile ourselves to the possibility that there is nothing beyond the grave.
  
  I am unqualified to speak about heaven or hell; I can only tell you what I believe and why I believe it.  I believe that the absence of God is hell.  I believe that is true on earth while we live, I believe it is true beyond the grave.  I cannot say there is a pit of fire; my faith tells me that absence from God is the worst of all punishments; worse even than the agony of burning flesh.  Do I believe this man when he tells us of his experiences?  I believe that he thinks it is real.  I have others tell of similar stories, and I have heard of the near death experiences where people are enveloped by a warm and loving light.
  
  I’ll know the answers to these questions in God’s good time.'
