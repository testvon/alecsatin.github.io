message: 'I lean towards Annihilation.
  Im not set on it, but I can reconcile it with Scripture (many others have done the heavy lifting) and it comports with my understanding (minute) of God.
  In short, I see earth as a petri dish in Gods lab.
  Some humans will turn out to be suitable for the Bride.
  Others not, but God will make the call, and scrape what he doesnt use into the bio-hazard receptacle.
  Bio-hazards are often incinerated. But not forever.'
