  What a story you relate.
  
  The "education establishment" is one of the filters by which quality teachers are eliminated before they could do any good.  I used to call these types of posts, <em>School makes stupid</em>.  A better name might be <em>Learned ignorance</em>.
  
  Thank you for not letting your values be destroyed by your experience, and for telling it here.
