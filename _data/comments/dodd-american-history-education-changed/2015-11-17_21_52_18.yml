message: 'Well, well, well! So thats what happened to our Public Schools! My husband and I love to study history, my specialty being medieval Tudor times. I am astounded at how much had been left out of my education compared to his. Hubby was born in 1948, Im 8 years younger. His education is far superior. When I speak to teenagers now, they are so ignorant its astounding! Most of them use the word "like" so much I can barely understand the conversation. Plus, they dress like street urchins or prostitutes. Sad really. Im going to share this with a conservative teacher friend. Im sure shell be able to incorporate this into her lessons somehow. Thanks Alec.'
