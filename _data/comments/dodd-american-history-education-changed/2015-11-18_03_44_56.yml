message: 'After being a full-time teacher for 12 weeks, I can safely say that education is not the goal. We really have no plans of teaching them anything, other than to jump through the hoops so they can pass the tests. But at the end of the day... they know very little. This is all forgiven if we get them to have some deep thought, or a conversation about the topic. That is success.'
