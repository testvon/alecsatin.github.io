message: 'After retiring from the service I kicked around a little bit then went to college, In the 25 years I had been out of the academic world I found what had happened to history and civics utterly shocking. Prereqs for a degree required one course in history and nothing for civics (its no longer even given). What history classes I could take were nearly pathetic, one teacher proudly professed the falsehoods that the only sane person on the allied side in WWII was Neville Chamberlain and that Byzantium had little to nothing to do with western culture. History had sank to a morass of personal opinion, false statements, and misinformation designed to solidify the professors personal liberal bias
  
  When a history professor began whining about Joe McCarthy and his House Unamerican Activities committee I stood and loudly demanded to know how a US Senator was put in charge of a committee in the House of Representatives. This is a lie that he had been teaching for years and not a single student had ever called him on this. Then again this confessed draft dodger had never had a proud 20 year military veteran who demanded good value for his hard earned tuition dollars sitting in his class room.
  
  I started taking education classes to see if I could make a change but there was no way I could. A voice of reason was drown out by a sea of empathy for race, sexual orientation, and a perceived need to let young teenage girls go to school dressed like hookers.'
