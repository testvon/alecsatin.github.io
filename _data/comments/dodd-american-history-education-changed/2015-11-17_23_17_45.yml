  Yes, with our perspective we can see the steady deterioration of knowledge and education step by step decade by decade.  Isnt it astounding?
  
  Teachers have gotten angry at me for stating the obvious: At the turn of the 20th century, many Americans had only a grade school education and learned to read with McGuffeys readers and phonics.  Yet they easily understood Henry James and Shakespeare.  They could also do all kinds of arithmetic in their heads.  And they could teach themselves all kinds of things.  And we need new methods and lots of tests and homework because????
  
  Thanks for passing the information on.<br />
  Alec
