message: "Hi James,\r\n\r\nGlad you liked Henry Jacobs' discussion of the Trinity.  There will be more like this coming, Lord willing next Friday.\r\n\r\nYes, understand all the points you've made.  Thankfully the Lord knows those that are His.  The apostasy is all around.  It should not surprise us - the Lord warned us beforehand in black and white."
