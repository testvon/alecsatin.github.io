message: "Thank you for this excellent article concerning one of the cardinal teachings of the Christian faith. I have never seen such a lack of discernment and a who cares attitude when it comes to the Trinity. So many anti-Trinitarian cults airing on so-called Christian radio/TV. SALEM Christian Networks airs a number of these cult programs. \r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, I noticed Greg Laurie's \"Harvest Crusade\" for 2016, had a cult listed for their crusade of supporting churches. This cult is an off-shoot of \"The Way International\". \r\n\r\nThis is one of the problems I have with Joseph Farah and his World Net Daily. Farah will lam-blast \"The Shack\" (Rightfully So), Bell, Warren (Rightfully So), and others yet support the Hebrews Roots teachers, and promote and sell the anti-Trinitarian Joe Kovacs. Many of Kovacs's unorthodox---un-Biblical articles are on Farah's site. Many of Kovacs's teachings are similar to the late Herbert W. Armstrong. Kovacs has duped many. I understand that Farah will promote and sell Kovacs's new book \"Shocked By The Bible 2\" A few years ago while researching Kovacs and his heresies, I sent my research to The Berean Call. They have two fine articles on Farah, Kovacs, and Michael Rood. \r\n\r\nRespectfully in Christ, James"
