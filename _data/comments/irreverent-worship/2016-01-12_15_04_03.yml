message: 'Agreed Glenn.  I really cant see how the type of applause youre describing can be seen any other way.   Although like Stan, applause is not a big deal to me.  Its more an indicator.  Or a mosquito next to a Grizzly.
  
  I spoke to one pastor about the ear-deafening volume of the music in one particular churchs worship service.  <em>Really?</em> he said.  <em>That bothered you?</em>
  
  Its like describing water to a fish.  They are completely unable to see it.  And when they get what youre saying, you become a "legalist" taking away their "Christian Freedom".  Uh, no.  Thats not what this is about.  At all.'
