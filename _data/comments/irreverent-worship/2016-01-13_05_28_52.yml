  We are blessed to have lovely music created by us in our bible study.  Its run something like a mini-church and Sunday school with individual small groups, and a lecture to the whole body.  We have 2 different sessions with congregational singing!  (And many talented singers and instrumentalists - like the lovely Z, e.g.).
  
  We had an elderly teacher who retired 2 years ago.  She used the old hymn books (but not exclusively) and picked ones that were relevant to the lesson that week.  She knew em all, boy!  We had a lot of GREAT songs and music (still do).  I LOVED so much of that singing.  But you know what?  One day an acquaintance turned to me after singing one of my favorites, and she said "if its one thing I REALLY dont like here is singing this old stuff out of <i>these</i>" as she tossed the hymnal down into the holder. I said nothing.
  
  Later she saw me singing lustily along <i>without</i> the hymnal (I have many memorized) and realized shed make a mistake.  It gave me an opening to tell her about their value in worship and good teaching (our teacher never picked bad ones).  She at least understood there was more depth to congregational singing than entertainment and excitement.  Once people are hooked on the adrenaline of the swell of of an entertainment service, I think only the Holy Spirit can move hearts back to a better mode of worship.  Maybe we should be praying for His moving through the congregation more than we do (than I do at least).  And that gets us right back to the top of your post, does it not?'
