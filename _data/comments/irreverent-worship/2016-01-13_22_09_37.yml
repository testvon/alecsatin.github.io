message: 'It is sad. Theyre bad about taking one word or phrase and saying it <i>ad nauseam</i>. Thats just too much for me. So far the only person Ive confided in is my husband. I do believe what the Apostle Paul teaches and that women should not speak out in the church but consult her husband. I have a tendency to view things a bit skewed (not just because Im female but also because I suffered a lot of emotional abuse as a child). Well, for now, I will attend the Sunday School because theyre actually teaching in that sphere. Thank you for your thoughts on it. I value your opinion greatly. Have a blessed day.'
