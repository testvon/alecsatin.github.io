message: 'You might enjoy this light postscript.  Remember the old Dick Van Dyke show?  I just remembered an episode where Rob and Laura were attending a (I think) synagogue service.  After the singing, or some event Rob raised his hands to claps, and Laura shushes him right down.  I twas humor then - being so out of sync that youd clap like that (as you write above) in church.  The whole, darn culture understood you didnt do that.'
