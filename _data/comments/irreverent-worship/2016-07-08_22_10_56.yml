  Still checking out your blog.  I remember Stans post and I believe I left a comment about how we dress for service.  Im sure I left one about music.
  
  In any case, I see how we dress as a manifestation of reverence as well, and have not gotten over the sartorial choices common today.  As a child growing up in a Roman Catholic family (Im now 61, BTW), polished shoes, neckties and jackets were mandated by my parents.  My sisters were in dresses with hats or bonnets and Mom covered her head as well.  There was a direct reference to the connection between how we dress and for Whom.   I understood it then and it stayed with me.  While I dont necessarily wear a suit for every Sunday service, its not for lack of reverence as much as lack of a decent suit that fits (Im working on it).  I rarely, if ever, wear jeans, and then only if going to a particular service was a last minute snap decision.  I never feel good about it because it just seems so disrespectful.
  
  I also have a problem with the music, and while it could simply be the I prefer traditional hymns, there is no doubt most of the "contemporary" music is simply bad.  Worse, however, is that the lyrics of too many are unacceptable.
  
  As to applause, I suppose it would depend upon what is being applauded.  The announcements of church business that includes reports of having reached a monetary goal (getting that furnace replaced) justifies applause.  A good performance by a singer or musician does as well and I dont think doing so means that the <i>focus</i> is the person, but just a natural response of appreciation for the persons God given talents used in praise of God.  While I do, however, believe it is more appropriate to save it for afterwards, it may also be for some another way to say "Amen".  After all, its a worship service, not a funeral.  Applause isnt necessarily a sign of a lack of reverence for the situation.  It might be a sign of reverence itself.  We are all moved in different ways.
  
  It puts me in mind of a joke I once heard, of a black man from a mostly black Baptist congregation on a business trip.  He finds only a mostly white "WASP-ish" church to attend on Sunday.  During the sermon, he responds as he and his fellow congregants back home does, with loud "Amens!" and "Praise the Lord!" at various points.  This the people find distracting.  Over and over the man gives out a "Praise the Lord!" as the pastor tries to focus on his message and the people try to follow.  Eventually, one usher feels compelled to approach the man and says to him, "Excuse me.  But we dont Praise the Lord! here."'
