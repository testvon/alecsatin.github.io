  So sorry to hear this - and am comforted to know <em>that Im not the only one who sees it</em>.  At one church, I really considered more than one week going to the Sunday School and skipping the service - just like you and your husband!  But Im so conflicted about it.  It makes such a strong statement.  What will the pastor think when he sees people at Bible Study but skipping the service?  I hate to put people on the spot like that.  I personally came to the conclusion that I cannot attend that church at all.  The possibility of worship of God there has been destroyed.
  
  I love what you wrote here:
  
  <blockquote>they’re not singing the old hymns AND there’s applause at the end of their sorry music productions. </blockquote>
  
  Sorry is right!  After the last time I attended that particular church, in a moment of unguarded tongue I told someone I trust, <em>How can they take the most amazing truth of the glory of salvation and of Jesus Christ and make it sound like a dopey off-key version of a Muzak tune?  And sing it badly!</em>
  
  Weve got to keep laughing.  Somehow God is allowing all of this.  Wherever 2 or 3 are gathered and all that.  Well get by even if all the churches go to pot.
  
  God bless you.
  Alec'
