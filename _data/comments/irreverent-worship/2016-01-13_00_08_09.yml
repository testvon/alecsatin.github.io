message: 'Thats amazing! This is what has been bothering me about the new church Hubby and I have been attending. Were not baptists but have been intermediately attending the First Baptist Church because we have many friends there plus a motorcycle group. Its a typical Protestant church except theyre not singing the old hymns AND theres applause at the end of their sorry music productions. Hubby and I are pretty fed up with it. I told him well go to Sunday School, because its a real learning experience and our same circle of friends, then skip the "service". Thank you confirming what Ive been feeling all along.
  Have a blessed day Alec. You sure have blessed me.'
