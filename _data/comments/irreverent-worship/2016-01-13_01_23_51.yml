message: 'Hi again Baysider,
  
  Perhaps youre right.  There very well may be.  In December I was preparing to write a series on what some have called "The Dones".  I did initial research and decided not to write it up.  The issue is complicated by the fact that there are multiple groups of people who decide to stop going to church.  I understand some of the reasons.  I also believe that God has commanded us <em>in times like these</em> to make sure not to forego weekly gathering with other saints. (Hebrews 10.25)
  
  Its surely not easy to know what to do.
  
  One thing, if the church is clearly off on essentials, its a no go.  But then the question becomes, <em>what are the essential essentials?</em>  If the church covers up pedophilia is that a reason to leave?  Or if it funds abortion?  Of if it denies justification by faith alone?  Or if it is legalistic?  Or if it is lawless (antinomian)?  Or if it denies the literal truth of the creation and the worldwide flood?
  
  Heres the good news, Baysider.  You already are drawn by the word and lifted above the clouds.  <em>the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his.</em> (2 Tim 2.19)  And God has given you <em>eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.</em> (John 10.28).
  
  And most comforting of all:
  
  "These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world." (John 16:33)
  
  Alec
