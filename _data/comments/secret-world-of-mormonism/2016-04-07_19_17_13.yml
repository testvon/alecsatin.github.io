message: 'These differences are important for accuracy - but the LDS church itself is as dark and evil as any of its siblings.  The "fundamentalists" of Mormon doctrine may have more overt violence and polygamy associated with them.  But this does not take away the occultism which seems to be "baked into" the system.  Baptism for the dead?  Masonic style oaths?  Blasphemous teachings about God the father?
  
  Just because the Mormons we meet in our daily lives may not know about or participate in these things does not change anything.  Pyramidal systems like this one dole out information based on power and position.  Their Jesus is not the Jesus of the Bible.  Their salvation is not the Bibles salvation.  Really, the whole thing is Satanic.'
