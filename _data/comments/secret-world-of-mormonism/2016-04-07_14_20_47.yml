  The main point for Christians is to understand that Mormonism has never been a Christian religious system, nor is it one now.  At the core its a gospel of works which does not believe the atonement of Jesus Christ is sufficient for salvation - amongst other serious issues which cannot be reconciled with the Bible.'
