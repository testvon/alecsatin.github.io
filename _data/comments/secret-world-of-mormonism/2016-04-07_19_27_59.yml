message: 'Oh, for sure both are equally evil.  The accuracy is important because too many people who encounter the LDS missionaries at their doors dont understand the differences and then get made to look foolish as the missionaries show them how wrong they are, and they use that as a stepping stone to teach the Mormon gospel.  Thats why the facts are important to know.  And Ive been involved with the whole Mormon issue, trying to straighten people out after theyve been slam-dunked by the missionaries, intervening on many blogs in the defense of the LDS, etc.  My point is that they are evil in and of themselves and we dont need to misrepresent them trying to make them look "bad."  Sometimes it can be a daily battle with them -- and I am currently engaging a Mormon on another blog (one Ive encountered before who wants to remain in denial no matter how many facts are presented to him).'
