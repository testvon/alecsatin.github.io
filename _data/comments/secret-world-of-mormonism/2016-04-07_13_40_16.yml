  The issue of Jesus and Satan being brothers is blown way out of proportion for sensationalism.  The thing is, according to LDS teachings, every angel and every human there ever was are also brothers and sisters of Jesus.  So when all created beings (angels actually are created as "human" spirits and later become angels) are brothers and sisters of Jesus, the sensationalism of Satan being a brother disappears.  He wasnt yet Satan ("Lucifer") when originally born (spiritually, from Heavenly Father and Heavenly Mothers).
  
  Polygamy is really only still taught among Fundamental LDS sects, although even with the Utah LDS it is still mandated in Doctrine &amp; Covenants 132.  So for current teachings, one really needs not to bring that up.  Polygamy is a good topic for discussing the history of the LDS as proof they are not true Christians because their claims about polygamy make the God of the Bible out to be a liar.
  
  Spirit babies dont "inhabit" the bodies of humans.  Rather they take on human bodies, and they arent "babies" when they do so.  They wait in the pre-existence until a human baby is conceived and then they take on that body (which has no spirit until then).
  
  "Blood atonement" is an old doctrine disavowed many, many years ago.  The LDS now claim that Brigham Young came up with that on his own and it wasnt from God.  The fun thing is when you get in a discussion about this and demonstrate that BY was/is considered a prophet of God, and he stated he got the doctrine from God; so how can you disavow a teaching from God as claimed by a certified prophet of God?
  
  Granny Geers stuff was published long ago, and her book -- "Mormonism, Mama &amp; Me" (which I recently donated to our local assembly) -- is about historical Mormonism rather than as currently practiced.  While its good for background information for demonstrating the ungodly nature of the LDS, it isnt too helpful when dealing with current LDS members.'
