message: 'Very observant.  "Those who would seek to recreate the world consider themselves above traditional morality" is so true.  News and information is strictly used to shape opinion and behavior.  In the old Soviet Union they had a saying about the two chief news organs of the government: <i>there is no Pravda (truth) in Izvestia (news) and no Izvestia in Pravda.</i> Still applies.
  
  At least those people knew they were getting blatant propaganda.  The serpent is much more subtle here - or <i>was</i>. It seems they have been emboldened to speak outright, known lies. For the reasons you cite, I suspect.'
