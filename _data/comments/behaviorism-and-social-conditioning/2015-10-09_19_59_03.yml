  Have never heard this.  Quite telling.
  
  How many of our people trust <em>the FOX</em>?  As Websters defines him, <em>A sly, cunning fellow.</em>  Youve heard the cry, <em>But FOX is conservative.</em>  So are fascists - but no educated person believes they are a threat today...
  
  Yes, lets trust that <em>fair and balanced</em> FOX.  He wouldnt lie to us...
  
  No Pravda in Izvestia nor Izvestia in Pravda.  So true.
  
  Thanks for your comment, Baysider.'
