message: 'I agree with you Alec.  It all boils down to the so-called news outlets, whether conservative or liberal, only report the news they want you to hear.  Or perhaps, better said, the government wants you to hear.  The conservative reporting can be an effective way of leading many to believe that something is being done and subtly diffuse their desire for change.
  I heard something very interesting on a local radio news station the other day, the announcer said very quickly, "All the news Obama wants you to hear."  Obama certainly has changed our country and has dashed the hopes of many keeping them in a cycle of poverty.  The mega rich get richer and the population of poor people grows.  That is the means of bringing about economic parity.  A few rich people while everyone else struggles to make ends meet.  Many, many changes in our nation.  I believe the visible church bears a large part of the blame for preaching lies and casting away the truth.  Thats why we have to keep preaching the truth.  God bless you Alec.'
