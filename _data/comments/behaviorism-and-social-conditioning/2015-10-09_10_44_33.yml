message: 'Hi Eliza,
  
  Yes, many are already there.  And still we have our work.  As Jesus said in John 4.35-38:
  
  <blockquote>
    Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest?  Behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.
    
    And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.
    
    And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.
    
    I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.
  </blockquote>
  
  So glad to hear from you Eliza.  God be with you.
  Alec'
