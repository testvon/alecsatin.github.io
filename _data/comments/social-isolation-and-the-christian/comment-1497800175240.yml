message: "Alec, appreciate your message on isolation, i can really relate. I'm glad that Mary Dalk shared your blog with me, I sure needed to hear what you have shared concerning loniness. For some twenty five years, I have been living with various health issues and chronic pain. It's unfortunate but merely having illness, people pull away and spiritual abuse you with their misplaced faith or there lack of understanding of scripture. It took me a long time to realize that these people were wrong. The silver lining to be unable to be involved in a woman's Bible study is , that God began to show me how ecumenical these popular teachers were. I have been driven to keep learning more in hopes of warning other women and I have. The rejection I felt was liken to my family, when I shared with them about being born again. With growing up in false church along with the many ecumenical places of worship I have the desire to warn others, but few will listen. In the last two years attending church has physically challenging and when I do go, I'm so frustrated with what's being promoted from the pulpit. \r\nYou are absolutely right, that we need to find ways to have fellowship. Right now I do feel so deeply sad and it's hard to push forward. I'm trying to stay faithful in the support group I started two years ago, in bringing scripture and encouragement. I feel so weary and unworthy to lead, I have made so many mistakes. The ladies have questions I can't not answer. I would appreciate prayers in that I can be faithful in the midst of my physical and emotional suffering. God bless you, in reaching out with your blog, it has encouraged me. Linda"
