  The church—a sound and healthy one, that is—is a community, also called in Scripture a spiritual house built of living stones (1 Peter 2:5).  I have maintained that the cement which holds the stones together is genuine friendship; the foundational infrastructure is sound doctrine and practice.
  
  I think you are right in your thoughts of simply speaking of our reality to another in the spiritual community—though we must be careful in trying to discern if the person is safe to confide in; that takes perhaps a little time. Healthy forests, or gardens, grow slowly.
  
  Thank you very much for sharing!'
