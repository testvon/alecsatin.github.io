message: 'Dear Lord, 
  Help my brother, Our brother, Alec in his struggles. You truly know his hardships and pain, and remind him that yes, its ok for a Christian to suffer in Your name, even if that suffering is one of loneliness and rejection. You in your wisdom planted us in enemy territory, a trial by fire, to find your true loving followers. Every week I remind myself of what our elder brother Charles Spurgeon, who himself struggled for years with depression, once said: "I walk through this sinful world as a pilgrim in a foreign country"
  
  Dear Father, hold Alec in your arms and lead him to a small church, full of loving bereans  who have been through the fire also, where the word sin is not alien to the pastors lips, and where the word love is always followed by "of Jesus" or "of God". Lead him to where the old hymns are sung with ghusto and the main accompaniment is not drums or guitars, but tears.
  
  And should You in Your wisdom lead him to the foot of the Rockies, where the very land points to Your Glory, let him know where he will find a small, loving community thats waiting for him. Ill bring the coffee.'
