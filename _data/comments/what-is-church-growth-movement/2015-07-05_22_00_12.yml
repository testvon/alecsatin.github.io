message: 'I really like your description of the purposes of the church (about 8 paragraphs in).  Weve lost sight of that in trying to be overly sensitive to seekers.  Someone gave me  John MacArthurs <i>Hard to Believe</i> as a gift (that sat on the shelf for years until last month).  I was amazed how much was in it.
  
  He has a great way to express this issue: "tastes great, less filling."  A gospel that calls us to self-fulfillment, not self-denial, is a non-starter.'
