This prayer comes from Hymns Ancient and Modern, number 477.  John Ellerton wrote it in 1870.  During World War II this hymn was used as a rallying call by captured [Allied soldiers](http://www.nww2m.com/2011/12/allies-and-axis-whos-who-in-wwii/) in Axis prison camps. It's still used today in England to commemorate [VJ-Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-J_Day_in_Times_Square).  

May the words be a comfort to you in this moment, and may your sleep tonight be sweet. Through Jesus Christ, our Lord. *Amen*

# The day thou gavest, Lord, is ended

The day thou gavest, Lord, is ended,  
the darkness falls at thy behest;  
to thee our morning hymns ascended,  
thy praise shall sanctify our rest.  

We thank thee that thy Church, unsleeping  
while earth rolls onward into light,  
through all the world her watch is keeping  
and rests not now by day nor night.  

As o'er each continent and island  
the dawn leads on another day,  
the voice of prayer is never silent,  
nor dies the strain of praise away.  

The sun that bids us rest is waking  
our brethren 'neath the western sky,  
and hour by hour fresh lips are making  
thy wondrous doings heard on high.

So be it, Lord; thy throne shall never,  
like earth's proud empires, pass away;  
thy kingdom stands, and grows for ever,  
till all thy creatures own thy sway.
