# What happened
My wife and I live in a modest co-op apartment in New York City.  It's a locked building.  That means the only people who should be inside are those who live there or have been invited by someone who does.

At times salespeople sneak in pushing various things.  Some are courteous and others aggressive.  But all are there under false pretenses.

## Triggers
Because of trauma in my past, strangers coming to my door often put me in a *fight, flight, or freeze* state.  If they look suspicious I'm ready to attack.  

Understanding that I'm riled up doesn't change the adrenaline pumping up my reflexes. With God's help I try my best to not rip the guy's head off.  But I don't want to be sold anything.  Nor do I want to be scammed.  

# Enter Con-Ed?
It's 8pm when the door buzzer sounds.  The cats scramble.  I jump to the door and look out the peephole.  Six inches away is thirtyish man in a hoodie and ragged t-shirt.  No uniform.  He's got some kind of lanyard around his neck, though no visible badge.  Feeling my fists clenching I take a deep breath and open the door. *Yes, what is it?*

The man flaps a Consolidated Edison electric bill just far enough away and at an angle where the name is obscured.  *I'm here because you're legally being charged too much since 2016.  If your account has 14 numbers and it's a residential rate, then you're being ripped off.*  He thrusts his hand at me and says, *Hi. I'm Anthony.  Who are you?*

## I don't want to shake your hand

Now, I don't like to touch anyone I don't know.  It's not a germ thing - it's a space thing.  I look at his hand then back at him giving what I hope is a neutral smile.  *Hi,* I say.  *I'm not interested in buying anything.*

## The race card

*You don't want to shake my hand?*  

I can see what's coming.  Now I'm irritated as well as angry.  Judging by the look of his jailhouse tattoos, he's a probable felon and as such has limited opportunities to make a living.  That's a shame and disgrace for our country of supposedly limitless opportunity.  I wish I could do something about that.  But alas I cannot.  I have no desire to antagonize him.  **But he's disturbing my peace and invading my home.**

He raises his voice and gestures at me.  *Oh yes!  I've got your number!  You don't want to shake my hand because of my race!*

With intense weariness and a desire to keep the situation from escalating, I raise my voice to his level.  *This has nothing to do with that.  I don't care if you're black, white, Christian, Jewish, or anything else, I don't want anyone coming to my door trying to sell me anything!  I treat them all the same way!*  I take a pause then add more quietly, *I'm sorry it came across that way.  Let's try this again.*

He looked at me.  Then looked again.  Then said, *OK.  I take my part too.  Let's try it again.*  He held out his hand then said, *I'm Anthony*.

This time I shook it.  

# Land of pervasive mistrust 

Have you lost sleep over the pervasive mistrust all around us in America?  I have.

This reading everything as *your group against my group* is getting worse.  Obama and Trump are equally to blame.  It's not just whites and blacks.  It's gays and straights.  It's blue and red in these un-united states.  

I don't care who you are.  If you see the stranger in front of you as a Trump supporter and read everything she does through that filter, then you are prejudiced and every bit as much an ugly racist as the people who have mistreated you.  You are the problem.

Now, Anthony has good reason to be angry at me.  I treated him poorly.  Other white men have no doubt harmed him in serious ways.  *But that doesn't make me his oppressor.*  And my desire to not be harassed in my own home does not make me a hater of black people.

## Where I failed

But...

I did not follow the golden rule.  I didn't care about his well-being when he knocked at the door.  I only wanted the irritation to be gone.  Lord forgive me.  Again.

# Open questions

## 1. Was he for real?

He said,  *I'm not selling anything.  That's why the super has allowed me to visit the apartments in this building*. 

But then later he said, *All I need you to do is to log on to your account and look at some numbers.  I'll be right here with you.*

If he worked for the utility company, why would he need to come into my apartment and have me log onto my account?

## 2. What is reasonable suspicion?

Does having reasonable suspicion mean that we change our behavior towards another person? If he was intending to defraud, should that change my tone?

## 3. What would you have done?

Do you have people soliciting coming to your door?  What would you have done if this had happened to you.

# Closing prayer
Dear heavenly Father.  You have created us all in your image.  There are many different types of people in your world, but only one race.  Deliver us from tribal hatreds.  Heal our fractured country.  Let us live quiet lives in peace.  Through Jesus Christ, your son, our Lord.  *Amen*
