# *The 51st State*

This program aired from 1972 to 1976 on the local New York City Public Broadcasting Station, channel 13.  There was no fixed length to each program.  Rather, the journalist was allowed to let the content determine it.

<blockquote>
  In short, we're going to try to capture the experience of a situation. And that takes time; to do that, you have to live with a storyâ€¦It's not 'what happened today,' because given the Day Book list of pseudo events, very little really happened today that is vitally or ultimately important. Our philosophy is rather: How do we live today? This is where the timeless quality comes in.[^77631ef1]

# A man of Christian faith



Mr. Teel, thank you for your heart-felt desire to overcome all darkness through the power of God's love.  May your example inspire countless others now and in time to come.



<blockquote>
  Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. -Matthew 5.16
</blockquote>



_Dear Lord, make me a blessing today.  In Jesus' precious name.  Amen_
