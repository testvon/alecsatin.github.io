Good theology and encouraging devotional material are not at odds with each other.  When asked for a recommendation for something "better" than a popular Christian title you'd recognize if I mentioned the name, a pastor answered, 

> Devotions should start with Scripture.

And that's true.  But maybe it doesn't have to be either or.  There is a need and a place for writings which take truths from God's Word and apply them to the strains and challenges of this life.  Who can better understand suffering than we who are members of the Body of Christ? 

# Devotional dearth

Why do the most popular devotionals have the most unorthodox teachings?  People who build their faith on the ideas found in books like [Jesus Calling](/biblical-orthodoxy/abraham-friend-of-god-jesus-calling/) may find it failing unexpectedly, leaving them stranded and bereft.  God help them.

On the other hand, those of us who have come through darkness know that the Word of God stands forever (1 Peter 1:25).  It - *he* - can be trusted to carry us through the murk.  There is no one better to guide the troubled than we who have been there and understand.

> Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.  -Galatians 6:2

# Prayer

Dear God of all comfort, be praised.  Thank you that we know from your Word that your care never diminishes.  You who have begun a good work in us will complete it.  Work through your people to comfort those who struggle today.  Help us all to know your love and through it, to have the fears and worries of our hearts soothed away.  Through Jesus Christ, thy son, our Lord.  *Amen*
