"There's something wrong with the world", said Morpheus to Neo in the famous 1999 film.  "The Matrix...has been pulled over your eyes to blind you to the truth."  

The Wachowski Brothers get some things wrong.  But their vision of deluded humanity enslaved in a fallen world is not far from the truth.

# The error of confusing Christianity, Christians, and Christ

You don't have to be an atheist to be disgusted by much of what is done in Christ's name.  Many real Christians feel the same way.  But your reaction is nothing compared to that of Jesus Christ himself.  He said,

> Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven...Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. -Matthew 7:21-23

And in another place,

> I know thy works..I will spue thee out of my mouth. -Revelation 3:15

There have always been far fewer real Christians than hypocrites. [^2t] Jesus anticipated this and repeatedly warned those who would be his followers:

> Enter ye in at the narrow gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:
Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few here be that find it. 

# Seek wisdom

Wisdom is the principal thing; 
therefore get wisdom: 
and with all thy getting get understanding.  -Proverbs 4:7

Here's to integrity, truth, and sincerity.  Let's keep in touch.

[^2t]: While all human beings practice hypocrisy at times, a hypocrite in this context is a person who claims to be a Christian, but rejects the [fundamentals](/biblical-orthodoxy/faith/) of Christian faith.
