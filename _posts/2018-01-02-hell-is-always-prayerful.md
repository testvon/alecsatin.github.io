excerpt:  "Rev. S. P. Long:  'I call your attention to the fact...'"
---

"I call your attention to the fact that hell is always prayerful. The rich man in hell was a prayerful man, not praying to the true and living God, but calling upon Abraham. The devil himself is a prayerful angel. The first thing he wanted Jesus Christ to do when he tempted Him, was to fall down and worship him. Satan knows of no better way of deluding the world than to come with a Bible under one arm, if it does not need to be opened – or to open the Bible, if you pick out only such things as say nothing about Jesus as the Savior of the world; he knows of no better way to delude the people than to have just as much religion as possible without Jesus Christ in it."
