When we talk about religious belief, it's good to remember the words of the Apostle Paul:

>For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. 1 Corinthians 13:12

There is not one of us who has our doctrine exactly right in all particulars. Having said that... 

# Outward appearances
...There's a person I know who has always been an excellent provider for his family.  He's worked hard, is well-liked, and has always sought to do the right thing.  He's a staunch defender of his particular brand of Christianity.  But what is the *object* of his faith?

>Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
Titus 3:5-6

Jesus himself warned that trusting in anything but him alone is a dangerous proposition:

>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. Matthew 7:22-23

We don't become acceptable to God (some people call this *saved*) because we are members of a church, but rather because we have personal faith in the saving work (the *atonement*) of the Lord Jesus Christ on our behalf. 

# Basic Principles

## The authority of God's Word
Real Christianity is based on a written revelation from the one true God.  The 66 books of the Holy Scriptures were penned by men who were guided by the Creator of the universe.  The Bible is free of errors and mistakes.  

The Book God's provided is your owner's manual and [Rosetta Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone#/media/File:Rosetta_Stone.JPG).  It answers why you're here and what the reasons are for the suffering you've experienced.

>All scripture is God-breathed, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: 2 Timothy 3:16

The Bible is understandable.  The more difficult to understand places are made clear by the easier passages.  The Holy Spirit always works through the Scriptures whenever the Word of God is spoken, preached, read, or contemplated.

The question of authority is one of the two ways true Christian orthodoxy differs from other religions.[^1] 

### The question of authority
There are two choices:

1. Authority = Holy Scripture alone, or, 
2. Authority = Holy Scripture plus tradition

Churches and religions which consider traditions as equal in authority to the Scriptures differ in significant points from Biblical orthodox Christianity.

Tradition can be oral or written.  Judaism and the Roman Catholic Church and religious systems which base their teachings on the Holy Scriptures plus oral traditions.  The Latter Day Saints (Mormons) and the Seventh Day Adventist Church base their faiths on Holy Scripture plus other books.

Creeds and confessions are helpful in understanding the Bible, but they do not supplant it.  For example, the *Apostles' Creed*, *Nicene Creed*, and *Athanasian Creed* are useful summaries of sound doctrine.  The *Augsburg Confession* and the other Reformation texts included in the *Book of Concord* are accurate expositions of Biblical theology.  

## Justification is the main thing

How are you made acceptable to God?  The Scriptures declare that man is made righteous before God by trusting completely in what the Messiah did to rescue fallen sinful human beings.  This is the essence of *justification by faith alone*.

Other religious systems believe that we can be made acceptable before God through our own efforts.  This *works righteousness* is in contradiction to verses such as Isaiah 64:6:

>But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. Isaiah 64:6

and Ephesians 2:7-9:

>That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:7-9

[Universalism](/ever-wonder/universalist-in-hell/) is the mistaken idea that everyone is or will eventually be right with God.  The truth is that reconciliation with God is a gift earned by Jesus Christ and given only to those who believe.  

This does not make faith a work.  

Faith is an indicator of one's state with the Lord. Justification by faith, not works, is among the most important aspects of [true Christian faith](/biblical-orthodoxy/faith/).

## Propositional truth
There are things which must be understood and believed.  Everything is not relative.  Absolute truth exists.  

The Bible is not just a book of poetic expressions of men trying to describe the incomprehensible.  Rather it is 100% factual and true in relation to the things it discusses.  Understanding what Scripture says and acceding to that understanding constitutes the basis of assurance.  Feelings and spiritual experiences happen universally to all people.  But they are no proof of salvation.  

## Law and Gospel
The distinction between Law and Gospel is very important in coming to a balanced understanding of Bible teaching.  Law and Gospel are found all through the Holy Scriptures.  The Law of God points out our sin and leads us to throw ourselves completely on the mercy and forgiveness of God provided through the one time atonement worked at the Cross by Jesus Christ.  

The Gospel is the *good news* that the work of reconciliation has been completed.  All that is needed is for you to *believe the gospel*.

## Contending for the faith
We are called to hold to the faith *once delivered to the saints* (Jude 1:3).  Why?  Because there are false gospels taught by false teachers.  These other systems do not offer true forgiveness for sins, and so *cannot save*.

Yet, sometimes one can become abrasive when speaking of these things.  So the proper attitude seems to be graciousness to others with a studiousness and commitment to know and live the gospel by the golden rule.[^85fc7e66]


What is it to behave graciously to others?  The apostle Paul tells us:

>...the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. (Galatians 5:22-23)

# Prayer
Dear Lord, may all who read these words share the prayer of that suffering man in the gospel of Mark who said, *dear Lord, I believe.  Help thou mine unbelief*.  Thank you that you have hidden these things from the proud but revealed them to the humble.  Continue to grant the gift of true saving faith through Jesus Christ.  Hallowed be thy name in all the earth, now and forever, world without end.  *Amen*

[^85fc7e66]: The golden rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  This is the basis of civilization.
