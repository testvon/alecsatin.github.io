The legalistic attitude, through which Church discipline is put theoretically on the same level as the preaching of the Gospel is one that cannot but result in the end in the subverting of the Gospel and in the prevalence of pharisaism. 

-Theodore Schmauk, as quoted in Sandt's Biography, chapter 19.

*Sandt's biography of Theoodore Schmauk* is now being prepared for publication as an e-book.
