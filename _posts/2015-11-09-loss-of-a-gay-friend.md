During the twenty years I was [living as a non-Christian](/memoirs/tarot-cards/) my friends were all unbelievers.  I still treasure the relationships I made then, though many have drifted away and others have chosen to break the ties.

Here’s something I received from someone I’ve known and loved for 15 years:



<blockquote>
  I'm flabbergasted! Gay upsets you.
  WOW!
  Enjoy your world.
</blockquote>



Ironically, this was in response to post written by someone else.  But that’s beside the point.

This old friend doesn’t seem to understand that I as a Christian see her and love her as a person, not as a “gay” identity.  So she projects onto me her rejection of the very idea of sexual right and wrong.  I become the law of God, hated because it awakens the knowledge of sin. In her mind she has no choice but to accept the gospel, or reject me.

Please pray that God will open the eyes of this friend, and all of our loved ones near and far who are on the losing side of their war with God.  If they remain unchanged, they will carry their hatred into the eternal beyond, and be separated from God forever.

# Prayer

Dear Lord, you are a patient God, not willing that any should perish, but that all would come to repentance. Forgive me for all the ways I fail to be a clear and honest messenger of your truth.  Help me to do better.  Please have mercy on my beloved friend.  Open her eyes that she might see.  Through Jesus Christ our precious Savior, and for His sake.  _Amen._
