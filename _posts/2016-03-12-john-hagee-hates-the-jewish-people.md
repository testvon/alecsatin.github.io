John Hagee, Senior Pastor of Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, is said to be one of the ten most influential television preachers[^5ff1fd07].  Mary Dalke on her [False Teacher Friday](https://living4hisglory.wordpress.com/2016/02/26/false-teacher-friday-learning-the-importance-of-being-a-berean-3/) for 26 February 2016, documents some of John Hagee's aberrant teachings regarding the person and work of Jesus Christ and his attitude towards the Jews.  Mary writes:

<blockquote>I must admit that many years ago, because of my deep interest in Bible prophecy, I used to listen to John Hagee...because of his strong emphasis on end time events and Bible prophecy. 

I had no idea what he actually taught about Jesus until years later when I came across this video! You will hear John Hagee — in his own words  — say some of the following shocking things:

_“The Jewish people as a whole did not reject Jesus as Messiah.”

    “Jesus did not come to earth to be the Messiah.”

"Since Jesus refused by word and deed to claim to be the Messiah, how can the Jews be blamed for rejecting what was never offered?"_

Another totally heretical teaching that John Hagee presents...there is no need to preach salvation to the Jewish people because they already have a relationship with God, and that their salvation comes through the Old Covenant. Some of his actual words are as follows:

_“I’m not trying to convert the Jewish people to the Christian faith.”

“In fact, trying to convert Jews is a waste of time.”_

Hagee got one thing right.  Trying to convert a Jewish person or anyone else is a waste of time.  Only the Holy Spirit working through the Word can bring saving faith.  Our job is to speak the Word and be ready to give a reason for the hope which is in us (1 Peter 3.15).  Salvation is the work of God.  But Hagee seems to know very little of these things.

*John Hagee false teaching about Jesus*

There is no one who hates Jewish people more than the one who refuses to tell them about salvation.



<blockquote>Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.
This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.
Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. (Acts 4:10-12)
</blockquote>



Teachers like John Hagee misread Scriptures to see two different salvations.  And they've taught a good number of well-meaning Christians this same lie.  It's a terrible deception.  _There is none other name under heaven whereby we must be saved_.

John Hagee hates the Jewish people because he refuses to evangelise them.  But it's even worse than this.  Hagee teaches everyone that Jews do not need to be saved.



# Jewish people need the Lord Jesus Christ

A Jewish person who dies today without faith in Christ has only suffering without end in store. The Torah is what will condemn them, not save them as that wolf John Hagee is teaching.

How many Jewish people have you known personally who have died without believing in Christ?  Their coming judgement and eternal future in hell is horrifying to contemplate. It should keep all of us up nights thinking about it.

When I learn of people like this John Hagee – I have to remind myself:

_For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. (James 1:20)_

God forgive us for holding this light in a covered basket as people all around us die in darkness.



# From a Christian born Jewish





What if no one had told [Keith Green](/keith-green-killed/) about true salvation through Jesus Christ?  What if nobody had told you?
