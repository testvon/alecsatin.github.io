> O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. -1 Corinthians 15:55-57

You may never have lived in a world free of suffering.  But if you are Christ's, you will.  His one-time and ultimate triumph over death is summed up in the last verse of Henry Milman's hymn:

In lowly pomp ride on to die.  
Bow Thy meek head to mortal pain.  
Then take, 0 Christ, Thy power and reign.  

One day the heavens will open and all will see the sovereignty of the Lord.  Until then you can rest certain that God's Word stands sure.  When the last trumpet sounds there will be new heavens and a new earth where there will never be any more darkness, suffering, nor death.  Even now, our Lord reigns.  Hallelujah.

# Prayer
Dear Lord, show us today your victory.  Forgive our forgetfulness, our tendency to see things through eyes of sight rather than eyes of faith.  Be with the pastors and teachers today who will open your Word that they divide it rightly.  Send your Holy Spirit into the minds and hearts of those who will believe that they might be saved.  Show us again your victory, that your people who are called by your name, trusting in you, will be lights in sin-cursed decaying world.  Through Jesus Christ thy Son, our Lord.  *Amen*

"Ride On, Ride On, in Majesty" by Henry H. Milman, 1790-1868

## Lyrics
  
1. Ride on, ride on, in majesty!  
Hark! all the tribes hosanna cry.  
0 Savior meek, pursue Thy road,  
With palms and scattered garments strowed.  

2. Ride on, ride on, in majesty!  
In lowly pomp ride on to die.  
0 Christ, Thy triumphs now begin  
O'er captive death and conquered sin.  

3. Ride on, ride on, in majesty!  
The angel armies of the sky  
Look down with sad and wondering eyes  
To see the approaching Sacrifice.  

4. Ride on, ride on, in majesty!  
Thy last and fiercest strife is nigh;  
The Father on His sapphire throne  
Expects His own anointed Son.  

5. Ride on, ride on, in majesty!  
In lowly pomp ride on to die.  
Bow Thy meek head to mortal pain.  
Then take, 0 Christ, Thy power and reign.
