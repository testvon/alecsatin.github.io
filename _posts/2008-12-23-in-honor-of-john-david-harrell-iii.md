On Monday night, June 30, 2008, a bright light departed. John was my buddy. He was one of my closest friends, and probably among the best friends of many people who knew him. He was in good health, always upbeat and filled with optimism. His death at 50 from an aortal aneurism was sudden, unexpected, shocking.

On hearing the news, one of our mutual friends, John Wotherspoon, said, *I think about that guy every day. How can it be that he is gone?*  When someone dies, they are never replaced.  The space John filled in our lives will never be filled by someone else.  

Still, we go on.

*John Harrell, III*

# All about love

John loved love. He devoted a great portion of his research, reading, experimentation and infectious enthusiasm to the development of techniques for opening the heart and manifesting love in all situations and circumstances. He sought by example to give love, grow love, share love, build and teach love.

# Service

At work, in his neighborhood, and in his friendships and dating relationships, John lived to serve.  Probably none of us that knew him knows the extent of all the ways he gave freely and without expectations of reciprocity.

# His Book

John was generous with his learning.  For the last 7 or 8 years of his life, John spoke often of his unpublished book, *Running and Being Love, Living the Runner’s High.* The title captures what he sought to live and desired for others.

John, God bless you my friend. The world was truly a better place for having you in it.

Thank you for all the times we shared.

May our paths cross again on other shores than these, in that place where we shall remember our tears no more, and where God will wipe every tear from our eyes.  In Jesus' name, Amen.
