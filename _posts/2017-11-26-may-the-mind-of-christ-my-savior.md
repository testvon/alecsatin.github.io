## Lyrics

```
1 May the mind of Christ, my Savior,
Live in me from day to day,
By His love and pow’r controlling
All I do and say.

2 May the Word of God dwell richly
In my heart from hour to hour,
So that all may see I triumph
Only through His pow’r.

3 May the peace of God my Father
Rule my life in everything,
That I may be calm to comfort
Sick and sorrowing.

4 May the love of Jesus fill me
As the waters fill the sea;
Him exalting, self abasing,
This is victory.

5 May I run the race before me,
Strong and brave to face the foe,
Looking only unto Jesus
As I onward go.

6 May His beauty rest upon me,
As I seek the lost to win,
And may they forget the channel,
Seeing only Him.

Kate B. Wilkinson
1913?
