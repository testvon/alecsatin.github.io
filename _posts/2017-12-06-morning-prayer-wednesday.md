## Morning Prayer for Wednesday

O ALMIGHTY And merciful God, gracious Father in heaven, Thou hast again, by the protection of Thy ministering spirits, the holy angels, kept me this past night, so that I have lived to see this day in good health and spirits. For this I earnestly laud, praise and magnify Thee, furthermore praying Thee, dear heavenly Father, in whose will I center all I do or leave undone, all my ends and aims, graciously to remember me also in future. Govern, I beseech Thee, with Thy Holy Spirit, my heart, mind and thoughts, all my designs and purposes, my words and works, that I may understand what is good or evil, and may in this wicked and perverted world so live and walk this day as, above all things, to be free from sin and to experience a heartfelt desire for that eternal home purchased and secured for me by Christ, my Savior – not forfeiting it by a life of sin. To this end graciously lend me the aid of Thy divine love and the power of the Holy Ghost, for Jesus Christ, Thy dear Son’s sake. Amen.
