In 2007 William Paul Young published a novel called _The Shack_.  To date more than 20 million English language copies have been sold.  The book has been recommended by evangelicals and non-Christians.  Defenders of _The Shack_ such as Baptist evangelist Kent Hovind claim that "it's just a story" and ridicule those who try to suggest otherwise. Even the author Stephen King has recommended this "life changing" book.

Is _The Shack_ just a book?  Are its critics just a bunch of gnat-straining hotheads?



# Paul Flynn's documentary

Paul Flynn has examined the issues of _The Shack_ thoroughly, and has come to these conclusions:





  1. _The Shack_ is explicitly theological in nature.  In interviews, William Paul Young states repeatedly that he is teaching theology through the story.


  2. _The Shack_ constitutes a direct attack upon Sola Scriptura, the foundational truth of the Reformation.



  3. _The Shack_ presents blasphemous representations of God, in violation of the Second and Third Commandments.



  4. William Paul Young presents a false view of the Trinity, including the idea that the Father became incarnate and was crucified.  This view has been known since the third century as the heresy of _modalism_.



  5. _The Shack_ presents heresies about Jesus Christ and the cross, denying the judicial substitutionary atonement.



  6. _The Shack_ suggests the teaching of universalism, that all human beings will be saved.



  7. William Paul Young does not believe in the Biblical doctrine of eternal hell.  Rather he teaches that hell is "restorative", a type of purgatory.






# The gospel of Aleister Crowley is the gospel of 'The Shack'





The "good news" according to _The Shack_ is that **people don't have to follow any rules, as there are no rules.  All men have been redeemed regardless of faith or repentance.**

Paul Flynn doesn't make the obvious comparison.  But anyone familiar with the works of Aleister Crowley, the self-proclaimed _wickedest man in the world_, will recognize William Paul Young's version of the gospel as the Thelemic core doctrine:



<blockquote>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.
</blockquote>

*Does William Paul Young realize how much similarity there is between his teachings in "The Shack" and those of the satanist Aleister Crowley?*




Do you really think God is okay with a book which makes the good news of Jesus Christ equivalent to that of the foremost Satanist of the Twentieth Century?

<blockquote>We worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; Neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance. For there is one person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Spirit.  but the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit is all one, the glory equal, the majesty coeternal.  Such as the Father is, such is the son, and such is the holy spirit. -The Athanasian Creed</blockquote>





"And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only [ye heard] a voice. And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, [even] ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone. And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it. Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day [that] the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire: Lest ye corrupt [yourselves], and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female," (Deuteronomy 4:12-16)





# Prayer



Dear Lord, thank you.  You are the alpha and omega, the beginning and the end.  Your truth stands eternal.  Your word can never be shaken.  Please protect your sheep.  Separate us now and forever from the goats.  And continue to save.  For Jesus Christ's sake, and in his name.  Be glorified today.  _Amen_.
