Some of you will remember this song from 1983.  The times were hard in the Eighties, and are demonstrably darker now.  But here's the thing: you and I are witnesses to the good news Anne Murray is asking to hear.  It's true that many are not interested and don't even recognize it to be good news.  But some will.

The best antidote to the sadness and disappointment the [spirit of the age](/ever-wonder/true-history-satan/) offers is to return to the truth again and again.  Thank God that he loved the world so much that he gave his Son that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but will have eternal life.  

Who can deny that that is more than, *A little good news, today?*

# Lyrics

I rolled out this mornin' the kids had the mornin' news show on  
Bryant Gumbel was talkin' 'bout the fighting in Lebanon  
Some senator was squawkin' 'bout the bad economy  
It's gonna get worse you see, we need a change in policy  

There's a local paper rolled up in a rubber band  
One more sad story's one more than I can stand  
Just once how I'd like to see the headline say  
"Not much to print today, can't find nothin' bad to say", because  

Nobody robbed a liquor store on the lower part of town  
Nobody OD'ed, nobody burned a single buildin' down  
Nobody fired a shot in anger, nobody had to die in vain  
We sure could use a little good news today  

I'll come home this evenin', I'll bet that the news will be the same  
Somebody takes a hostage, somebody steals a plane  
How I wanna hear the anchor man talk about a county fair  
And how we cleaned up the air, how everybody learned to care  
Whoa, tell me  

Nobody was assassinated in the whole Third World today  
And in the streets of Ireland, all the children had to do was play  
And everybody loves everybody in the good old USA  
We sure could use a little good news today  

Nobody robbed a liquor store on the lower part of town  
Nobody OD'ed, nobody burned a single buildin' down  
Nobody fired a shot in anger, nobody had to die in vain  
We sure could use a little good news today
