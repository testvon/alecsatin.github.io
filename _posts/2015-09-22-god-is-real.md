Even in our fallen state, God loves human beings.



# The world exists - and you’re in it



Reality exists apart from your thoughts.  You live in a world that God made and sustains.  Wisdom, understanding, and true knowledge come from consistently choosing reality over illusion. Keep your eyes and ears open, and notice what's going on around you.  Put your electronic filters away and perceive things for yourself.



# The owner’s manual for the human race



The only real God - _who created you_ - has provided an owner's manual which explains everything you need to know in a language you can understand.  The Creator is sane and logical. His Book confirms everything we’ve observed about scientific and physical reality.

You can trust Him and His Word.

The Bible is one unified and historically accurate narrative.  It tells how God has saved people throughout recorded history, and is still saving people today.  The saved men and women from every nation are grafted into the one people of God.



# What is the Messiah?



At the appointed time, the Jewish Messiah came to earth as predicted in specific prophecies that were written down hundreds of years previously.  The Messiah was born of a virgin mother, lived a perfect and sinless life, and chose a sacrificial death he did not deserve.

On the third day after his body was declared dead, he physically came back to life and was seen by 500 witnesses.  Thomas touched him and testified to this fact.  Jesus then ascended in physical form to the Father.

Jesus Christ was the one-time [Passover lamb](/letter-to-dying/) who through his sinless life, death and resurrection atoned for the sins of His people.

The Messiah - who is God - saves Jews and those from every other nation who believe through faith in God's forgiveness through the blood sacrifice of the Messiah, Jesus Christ.
