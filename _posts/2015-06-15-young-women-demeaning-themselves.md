# Scene 1 - At the Target



It’s a quiet morning at the Target. The long aisles are almost deserted. I’m halfway down the coffee and tea aisle when the sound of a woman cursing into her phone drowns out the Muzak. She’s young, probably not even 20 years old. And the graphic detail of her language is truly ugly.

Don’t think I’m shocked. We’ve all heard all the words. The issue is not embarrassment (though maybe it should be). It’s the protectiveness of a father for a daughter, or an uncle for a beloved niece. With every word, this girl is harming herself. And she doesn’t even know it.

I wrote recently about the enemy’s love of demeaning people. How much more glee he gets when those which should be the most innocent of us are deeply involved in their own humiliation?

Now, you might be asking, _What’s wrong with some bad language? She’ll grow out of it. And even if she doesn’t, they’re only words._ Yes, all true. But words have meaning. And the quality of the language you use is an accurate marker of the quality of your heart.



>Do not ye yet understand...those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. 19 **For out of the heart** proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness,** blasphemies**: 20 These are [the things] which defile a man: - Matthew 15.17-20




The volume of the girl’s speaking was anything but lady-like. That was bad enough. But it was the content which was obscene. And she didn’t seem upset. _This was her normal way of speaking_. When I got to the end of the aisle, I waited until her phone call was over then stopped to get her attention.

“I couldn’t help but overhear some of your conversation. Is everything okay?”

“What do you mean?”, she asked.

“Well, the way that you were speaking is concerning. You are humiliating yourself with your language. I know that you don’t mean anything by it. But it’s true. Whenever anyone hears you speaking like that, they will think less of you, whether they tell you or not.”



# Scene 2 - Around the neighborhood





>Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price [is] far above rubies. -Proverbs 31.10




It’s a beautiful Spring day on a residential city street in an American city. Two normal looking women in their 20’s are having a conversation on the street corner as they wait for the red light to turn. What they’re saying would make Jerry Springer blush.

“Well I told him that he couldn’t <fill in the blank> because he <fill in the blank> and <curse> <curse> <fill in the blank>,” says woman 1.

“That <curse> does that every Friday night!” says woman 2.

“It’s <curse> boring, <blasphemy> <curse> <curse>,” says woman 1. Then they both laugh and continue. They are speaking so loud that it’s impossible not to hear them half a block away.



# Vive la différence



The farther American society moves to deny biological reality, the stranger things become. Just imagine how ugly the world would be if all women were hard and cold. Just as we see boys being punished for being boys, girls are being trained to adopt the most despicable male traits imaginable.

>Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. -Exodus 20.7
