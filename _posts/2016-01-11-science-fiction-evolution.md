There have always been exceptional scientists who are also Christians.  But according to the media and to *official science*, athiestic denial of the creation is the only acceptable view.

Yet, the theory of evolution has yet to be proven.

This three minute short explains what it would take for the simplest cell to form by accident.

The idea of life arising by pure chance is a mathematical impossibility.  Darwinian evolution is science fiction - a false religious belief - touted as fact.
