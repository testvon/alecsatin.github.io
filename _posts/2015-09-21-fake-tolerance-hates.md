Truly tolerant people understand a fundamental truth: hating people simply because they are different than you is an ugly thing.



# The *acceptable ones*



Unfortunately tolerance as a social movement is something very different from _live and let live_.  This new kind of tolerance is even more hate-filled and destructive than the groups it’s supposedly against.  This new kind of *tolerance* hasn’t eliminated anything.  Nor has it made the world a better place.  All it’s done is create a new division in the world:

1. The acceptable ones, who are *tolerant*, and
2. The unacceptable ones, who are not.

And as we’ve all learned from social media and the movies, anything goes when it comes to *mobbing* and *shaming* the ones who are *intolerant*.




## The double standard



Tolerant people love to laugh at _intolerant Christians_ who believe the Bible is true.  They make no secret of their disdain.

The woman on this clip was spat upon on national (British) television.

When was the last time a television station was bombarded with calls from tolerant people who were offended by mockery of Christians?

# Protected classes create intolerance



At the same time Christians are being punished for their faith, other citizens are rewarded.  Some of these people are in what are called _protected classes_.  Anyone who dares speak against a member of a protected class is by definition _intolerant_.  Such people are increasingly subject to civil and criminal penalties and other forms of abuse.



# Scientific shaping of the new Amerika



Few people these days suspect that social manipulation on a large scale can be done.  This serves the demographic [behaviorists](/spirit-of-the-age/behaviorism-and-social-conditioning/) behind the scenes just fine.  One of their favorite techniques is _divide and conquer_.

Citizens who judge and mistrust each other hate each other too much to ever come together against a common foe.  And few things divide people more than moral intolerance.  How much more powerful this force is when it hides behind the label of *tolerance*.

Religions tell people what is "good" and "bad", "right" and "wrong".  Some religions like Biblical Christianity include the rights for other people to think and behave freely, even if they do not share Christian religion.  

Many other religions will not tolerate any dissent.

There’s a religious war being cynically fomented between Islam and the West.  And there's an equally intolerant one heating up against Christians by the supposedly tolerant ones.



# Totalitarian overtones



Murder and persecution in Europe didn’t start with _The Final Solution_.  The first step was social isolation of what were termed *moral degenerates*.  These were people who did not fit to the new fascist virtues.  Next came the training of the next generation to despise the *outsiders* as enemies of the *homeland*.

# What proponents of *the new tolerance* demand of Christians







  1. Shut up about *that kind of Christianity*.  No one cares what you think. [See this comment](/memoirs/tarot-cards/#comment3)


  2. Update your religion.  Where the Bible’s *intolerant*, reject it.
