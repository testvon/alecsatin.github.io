>And all these were uttered hundreds of years before they came to pass, but were all exactly and accurately fulfilled. "On how many things does the veracity of God depend, the failure of any one of which would prove Him false." How completely are all the contingencies of life under His control, to bring about all His purposes and designs. Nothing escapes His notice. There is nothing but what He overrules and directs for the accomplishment of His own ends. All His power is pledged for the performances of His promises. Heaven and earth shall pass away sooner than one jot or tittle of His word shall fail. The most minute events all bear their part in the great economy of God, and all tend to the working out of His plans. Upon how many little, apparently accidental circumstances did the birth of Christ in Bethlehem depend. – Samuel Laird, "Attraction at Bethlehem"

## About the Rev. Samuel Laird

![Samuel Laird](/assets/images/i01-samuel-laird.jpg)

>Dr. Laird belonged to a group of stalwart preachers and leaders whose influence could not be confined to a congregation or a city or a synod...They rose into prominence at a time when Lutheranism in its English form was passing through a crisis because it had in large measure forgotten the rock whence it was hewn and the pit whence it was digged. Though his modesty forbade him to assume the role of leader in the controversy...he was a staunch defender of the principles for which it stood. He was wont to speak with much admiration of the men who bore the brunt of the battle, and more than once characterized them with the brief sentence, "There were giants in those days," not once thinking that he was one among them. -[George Sandt](http://www.lutheranlibrary.org/102lb-sandt-schmauk-biography/)

## The Attraction At Bethlehem

_The following sermon is taken from "Selection of Sermons by Samuel Laird" published by the General Council Publishing House in 1914. The full collection of sermons is scheduled to be republished by [The Lutheran Library Publishing Ministry](http://www.lutheranlibrary.org/) in 2018._

>"Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing "which is come to pass. – Luke 2:15. 

It frequently happens that places comparatively insignificant in themselves, are dignified by the events which transpire at them. "What cannot ennoble greatness, greatness can ennoble." Towns and villages that would forever have remained in obscurity, or been known only to few, have had fame thrust upon them, and been honored by the historian and the poet, by some scene or transaction that happened there.

"The late emperor of France, while besieging Mantua in Italy, exempted a small neighboring village from all exactions, in honor of Virgil, whose birthplace it was supposed to be." Who has not heard of Avon, rendered famous by one of England's greatest poets? How many places have claimed the honor of being the birthplace of Homer? With what reverence is our own Mount Vernon regarded, because there repose the remains of the Father of his Country. What interest clusters around the places noted in Scripture history, and especially those ignored by the presence of our Lord. Nazareth was held in low esteem and even despised, but it is now highly regarded and even ennobled, since our Saviour passed his youth and earlier years there. "Capernaum was an insignificant fishing town, but because He frequently resided and preached in it, it was exalted unto heaven." And so "Bethlehem was not remarkable for its buildings or commerce, or the number of its inhabitants, or fame of any kind. It was 'little among the thousands of Judah.' But it was immortalized by an event that fixed upon it the eye of inspiration, that drew towards it in due time a multitude of the heavenly host, and has rendered it dear and memorable to the church forever: it is the birthplace of the Messiah." "_Thou, Bethlehem Ephratah," says the prophet, "though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall He come forth unto me, that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from old, from everlasting._" In this city of David was born a Saviour which is Christ the Lord. And it was the announcement of these glad tidings by the angel to the shepherds watching their flocks by night upon the plains of Palestine, and the strange events that accompanied it, that led them to say "_Let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass._" Come with me then and let us follow in the footsteps of the shepherds, and go even to Bethlehem and contemplate a scene which will induce us to exclaim, as Moses did on a very marvelous but very inferior occasion, "_Ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing, or hath been heard like it?_" And whither are we conducted? To some magnificent palace? To a scene of grandeur and dignity? The announcement of the angel, the shouting of the heavenly choirs, the appearance of that bright star have raised high our anticipations, and led us to expect something grand and noble. But what do we behold? A babe wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger. Its surroundings are lowly and mean. It finds shelter in a stable. Its parents are not numbered among the dignitaries of the land. There is no pomp or display in their circumstances or demeanor. To the outward eye, there is nothing of greatness in that scene. And yet upon that unconscious babe reposing in the manger, the whole universe looks with wonder and with awe. What is it that commands the absorbing attention of the heavenly hosts? What is there in this event which draws so much interest upon it from all God's intelligent creatures! Why do the angelic orders bend over and gaze upon it with so much wonder and delight? Let us inquire and see what there is in this thing which is come to pass to cause so much commotion in heaven and on earth. 

## I. First we see here a union of the divine and human natures. 

In that little babe we behold "_God manifest in the flesh._" The Former of the worlds comes down to live for awhile upon this globe. The Ruler of the Universe abases Himself to move among His subjects. The Inhabitant of the Skies takes up His abode among men. He who occupied a throne of glory, now dwells upon His footstool. He who was with the Father from all eternity, and was in all respects equal with God, appears as a servant. Divinity clothes itself in the garb of humanity. God allies Himself with man, takes upon Himself the form of a man, and manifests Himself in the flesh. In Jesus Christ, God and man were so united as to form one person. Divine and human properties are alike ascribed to Him. He "_being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men._" The names of God are ascribed to Him. Isaiah says, "_His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, the mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace._" Jeremiah calls him, "_The Lord our righteousness._" Thomas on beholding Him after His resurrection from the dead, exclaims, "_My lord and my God._" Paul declares Him to be "_God over all blessed forever._" John speaks of Him as the "_King of kings and Lord of Lords_." And yet also the names and titles of a man are given to Him. He is spoken of as the Promised Seed. He is called the Son of Man – the Son of David – the son of a Virgin – the second Adam – and by two of His Evangelists His genealogy is traced out, and the names of His ancestors are given by one as far back as David, and by the other back even to Adam. 

He wrought works which none but God could do, and at the same time performed actions and deeds that are only becoming a man. He created the world and all things visible and invisible. The apostle John says, "_All things were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made_." He also sustains and preserves all things, for Paul tells us, "_By Him all things consist_." He quickeneth the dead, for the Scriptures declare that He "_quickeneth whom He will_." He is the author of eternal life, as He Himself says of those who follow Him, "_I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish_." He is the Judge of the world, for we are expressly told that "_the Father judge th no man; but hath committed all judgment unto the Son_," He performs and possesses all things equally with God. And yet, though He is the brightness of the Father's glory and the express image of His person, still as a man He came into the world in the form of a babe. Though as God in Him was the infinite perfection of the Deity, yet as clothed with humanity we are informed that He grew and "_increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man._" Though as God He was incapable of committing sin, and could not be tempted, yet as man He suffered those bitter temptations of the devil in the wilderness, still, however, without sin. Though as God He stood in need of nothing, yet as man He endured hunger and thirst. Though as God He ruled all things by a word and knew no want of energy, at the sound of whose voice even the winds and the waves were calmed to peace, yet as man He became wearied and fatigued. Though as God He needed no rest, and His watchful eye was ever open to behold all the events transpiring in the universe, yet as man He slumbered and slept. Though as God He was raised above all grief and affliction, yet as man He endured pains and sorrows and wept bitter tears. Though as God He would laugh in derision at all the efforts of His foes against Him, yet when manifested in the flesh He was buffeted and scourged by His cruel enemies. Though as God He could call even the putrid dead from their graves, yet upon the cross He gave up the ghost, and His lifeless body was buried in the tomb. . "_Being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross_." "_In all things it behooved Him to be made like unto His brethren_," according to the flesh. We find then many things ascribed to Him which cannot pertain to Him as God; and many others ascribed to Him which cannot pertain to Him as man; the only mode of explaining the difficulty is that in His person the divine and human were united – God and man were conjoined. And in the circumstances of His birth at Bethlehem we have the same combination of the lowliness of humanity with the glory of the Deity. What circumstances of abasement and humility surround Him at the time of His birth. It is not attended with any earthly pageantry or glory. His mother is an obscure virgin, so little thought of and possessing so little of this world's goods, that no room can be found for her in the inn. The shelter afforded Him on coming into the world was no better than that given to the beasts of the stall. The cradle that held the sleeping babe was a manger. No goodly apparel wrapped His little form; no soft pillow supported His young head. All His surroundings were of the meanest order. By these evidences of His abasement was He surrounded. And yet where can we find such manifestations of Glory as in the birth of Jesus. Prophets foretold it. The time and place of it were specified long before. Heavenly visitants announced it and directed His parents what to call Him. At His birth the very heavens are lit up with glory, and the heavenly choirs are heard chanting their hymns of praise, singing, "_Glory to God in the Highest, and on earth peace, good will to men._" The constellations of the firmament have a new star added to their number, which shines with brilliant luster on account of the wondrous event which has happened. Magi from the east, guided by its light, come to pay their homage and make their offerings to the new born king. All these circumstances attest the wondrous nature of the great thing that came to pass. Heaven shows its interest in the babe, and angels come to sing at the birth of Him whom they adored in heaven. These honors are heaped upon the infant Jesus, the Lord from heaven, in whom dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. 

That Christ was divine as well as human is shown also from the fact that He existed before He was born into this world. At His birth, as the apostle says, He was only manifested in the flesh. He did not then only begin to live. This was not the commencement of His existence. It was at this time that He took upon Himself our nature in addition to or in conjunction with the Divine nature, which He had before. When He was born into this world He did not then just come into being. Before that He had lived. From all eternity He had existed. The very expressions He Himself used show this. He said, "_Before Abraham was I am_," and in one of His prayers in addressing the Father He said, "_And now, O Father, glorify thou Me, with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was_." The apostle uses this language concerning Him, "_He came unto His own and His own received Him not_." Before He could come He must have had a previous existence; there must have been a condition and a state from which He proceeded, that condition was the divine, and that state the heavenly. And not only did He exist before His incarnation, before His coming in the flesh; but he existed on an equality with the Father and from all eternity. "_In the beginning was the word and the word was with God, and the word was God_." The shepherds then, as they gazed upon that babe in the manger at Bethlehem, beheld the God-man Christ Jesus, the Only-begotten of the Father, now come down to dwell among men. 

## II. In the second place we see in this thing which is come to pass, a fulfillment of prophecy 

– we behold a striking display of divine truth – a verification of the inspired word. The coming of the Messiah was called "the truth of God." The advent of Christ into the world was the chief promise ever given to man. It was the hope of the world – the event which was looked for with joy, and hailed with gladness and rejoicing. It was the earliest assurance made to man. Scarcely had our first parents sinned, and become subject to all the woe that sin entails, before a deliverer was promised them. And what a length of time the promise seemed to hang in suspense. A year rolled by and yet He came not. A hundred years passed away and yet He had not appeared. A thousand slowly went by, and Adam died without seeing the fruition of his hopes. Another thousand glided away, and the patriarchs looked with anxious eyes for Him, but he came not. And still another thousand years came and went. And during all that time the fulfillment of that promise lingered. It was foretold that He should descend from a particular nation – the nation of the Jews. Hear the words of the prophet:

>"Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said; he hath said wHich heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the Most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance but having his eyes open; I shall see Him but not now; I shall behold Him but not nigh; there shall come a star out of Jacob and a scepter shall rise out of Israel; out of Jacob shall come He that shall have dominion."

The particular family also from which He should arise was named – the family of David – as saith the prophet Jeremiah, "_Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise up unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth, in His days Judah shall be saved and Israel shall dwell safely_," Even the place of his birth was mentioned by Micah, "_But thou Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall He come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from old, from everlasting._" The very circumstances attending his advent were minutely foretold, the murder of the children in Bethlehem in these words, "_A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children because they were not._" His forerunner, John the Baptist, is thus noticed by the prophet Isaiah – "_The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God,_" And all these were uttered hundreds of years before they came to pass, but were all exactly and accurately fulfilled. "On how many things does the veracity of God depend, the failure of any one of which would prove Him false." How completely are all the contingencies of life under His control, to bring about all His purposes and designs. Nothing escapes His notice. There is nothing but what He overrules and directs for the accomplishment of His own ends. All His power is pledged for the performances of His promises. Heaven and earth shall pass away sooner than one jot or tittle of His word shall fail. The most minute events all bear their part in the great economy of God, and all tend to the working out of His plans. Upon how many little, apparently accidental circumstances did the birth of Christ in Bethlehem depend. For Joseph and Mary were residing in Nazareth. And had not Judea been under the Roman dominion; and had not Caesar Augustus wished to know the number and wealth of his subjects, so that he ordered an enrollment of all the people in his dominions; and had not the parents of our Lord been thus compelled to go up to the city of David," He would have been born elsewhere, and the word of God would have been of none effect. And all these occurrences appear casual; and they were so to the persons themselves; but not to God; He knows all His works from the beginning. All the prophecies of the God of truth have been verified to the very letter so far as they have yet come to pass. We have here the strongest assurance that those still to be fulfilled will just as surely meet their accomplishment. Everything that had been foretold concerning the birth of Christ was accurately fulfilled. Nothing was wanting. Even the little minutiae were all accomplished. Occurrences which seem to us trivial all contributed to verify the truth of God's word. Men waited long for the promised Messiah, but they waited not in vain. Though He tarried long, He came at last, came in the fullness of time, according to the previously announced purpose of God. As we take another view of the manger at Bethlehem, we have another witness to God's truth. Let our confidence in Him never be shaken. 

## III. Again in this great thing which is come to pass, we see provision made for our salvation. 

For the glad tidings of great joy which the heavenly messenger brought to the shepherds were "_Unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord._" The joyous proclamation he makes and sounds aloud that all may hear, is, "Look unto me and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth." The angel that foretold his birth directed that His name should be called Jesus, because He should save His people from their sins. He Himself declared that He came to seek and to save that which was lost. It was this that the prophet referred to when he said, 

>"Surely He hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows. He was wounded for our transgressions; He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and with His stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all." 

He is the bright sun of righteousness whose rays are the light and healing of the earth, and the joy of eternity. He is the "_Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world." "He is the fountain opened to the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and uncleanness._" He is the "_Branch of the Lord, beautiful and glorious,_" whose name is "_the Lord our righteousness_." He is the "_Rock of Ages_," on which frail man finds his salvation, and in whose cool shade this world's weary ones are blessed. He is that Root of David which has penetrated through the fissures of opposing rock and forced its way to the fountain and waters of life. He is the 'Rose of Sharon' and the 'Lily of the Valley,' which God has planted in this bleak world to gladden the eye and revive the heart of drooping man, and be a soothing balm to His many, many wounded.  He is the meek dove that has left the pure air and blissful groves of heaven to be torn and immolated for the purifying and cleansing away of guilt. Behold here then the Saviour that has made His soul an offering for thy sins. For this He left His bright abodes on high. For this, though rich. He became poor. For this He laid aside His dignity and honor and glory and descended even to our lowly world, and appears in the form of flesh. He came to save sinners; to die that we might live; in His love and pity to redeem us. The incarnation of Christ was the first step made in the working out of the plan of salvation. That plan, it is true, had been formed long before. Various events had happened which looked to its development. But the first grand act of the Deity in actually making provision for our salvation was sending His Son to our earth to assume our nature. The manifestation of Christ in the flesh was an earnest of what God purposed to do for our redemption. As those shepherds gazed upon the Infant in His manger cradle, how their hearts must have thrilled within them when they called to mind all the grand and glowing promises of deliverance and blessings which were to be fulfilled in the Redeemer. As they looked upon Him they were assured that God really meant what He had said, and that here was the beginning of the great work which was yet to be wrought out. The Saviour of the world had come. The great Redeemer was now born, who had come to reconcile a rebellious world to their offended Sovereign. Through Him the sons of Adam could come back to their allegiance to their rightful Lord. Through Him heaven and earth could once more hold loving communion with each other. From henceforth peace from God towards men was assured. Through Him pardoning mercy was vouchsafed to guilty man. Now at length the great sacrifice was being made ready, through whose offering myriads of souls should be redeemed from the power of sin and the thralldom of Satan, and made heirs of everlasting life. The victim to be offered up on God's great altar had now been provided. Through His blood-shedding salvation was freely and fully offered to all who would come and accept. It is in this, His great work – a work which God alone could undertake – that it is our privilege to contemplate Him. It is in this capacity that the apostles love to speak of Him; and to manifest Him to a weary and sin-stricken world as their only hope and salvation. Look then, thou frail child of clay, upon this great thing that has come to pass, and as you look, accept and live. Draw near to that rude manger at Bethlehem, thou desponding and guilty one, and behold thy Saviour and Redeemer, the Shepherd and Bishop of thy soul. 

But "great as this thing is which has come to pass, there are many who will refuse to take a step to see it. Even at the very festival which is the commemoration of it, they will be found anywhere rather than at Bethlehem. They will be attracted to anything rather than to that sight which the shepherds left their flocks and made haste to see; which the Eastern Magi came such a distance to behold, and which drew all heaven down to earth. Some, while they observe the day by a freedom from labor, not only neglect, but insult the subject of it, and by intemperance and riot revive the works of the Devil, which the Son of God was manifested to destroy." How many will spend this day in sensual and groveling pursuits, and instead of improving it as a time to feed their soul, will only use it in ministering to their appetites. How many will give themselves up to the joyous hilarity of the season and bestow not one thought upon the great event it is meant to commemorate. There should be joy and rejoicing, but with a reference to those glad tidings of great joy which have been proclaimed to men. It is well to put aside our sorrows and our cares, to deck our houses with garlands of green, and to spread happiness all around; but let our hearts recur to Him who alone can effectually remove all sorrow, and who is the only true source of happiness. It is well to give gifts, to renew friendships, and to hind tighter the cords which hold us together in our social life. But while all this is done, forget not the great gift which God has bestowed upon men. 

Let us celebrate this glad day by joining our voices with those of the heavenly choirs above in giving "_Glory to God in the Highest_," and proclaiming "_peace on earth, goodwill to men_." Let your thoughts dwell upon that wondrous event – the Son of God incarnate. Renew your solemn vows of devotion and consecration to Him. Let your love be firmly fixed upon that Saviour whose love moved Him to descend to earth for you. 

Give a hearty welcome to this Glorious Prince of Peace. Welcome Him to the earth, and at the same time open your hearts for His reception. Treat Him not as did the ungodly race dwelling upon the earth at the time of His Advent. Let Him not be cast out from your homes as too mean and poor to be allowed to dwell there. Give Him the freest and heartiest welcome your natures are capable of. Remember that this lowly Babe upon which you gaze as it lies in its manger cradle, is at the same time the Mighty God. He will come again to take vengeance upon them that know not God, and that obey not His Gospel, and to bless His own people. He has come to restore you to your proper dignity; to reconcile you to your God. "No longer continue in arms, rejecting His authority, trampling upon His laws, and refusing the offers of His grace; otherwise war, eternal war, will continue between you, and the Lord God Omnipotent." But only let the haughtiest sinner submit to His government this day, and all the blessings he came to purchase shall be bestowed upon him. Let all enmity be laid aside, all opposition fade away, and as you this day call to remembrance that strange scene upon which the shepherds gazed at Bethlehem, let your hearts rejoice, and your lips exclaim, "Lo, this is our God, we have waited for Him, and He will save us: this is the Lord: we have waited for Him: we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation."
