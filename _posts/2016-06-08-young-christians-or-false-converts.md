{% include toc title="Contents" icon="book" %}



College students talk with a gospel preacher named James outside of Bill Johnson's Bethel Redding Church in Redding, California.  They've just attended a "miracle service" officiated by Benny Hinn.

This strange short video raises many questions:





  * What does it mean to "be in God's presence"?


  * Is theology the divisive factor in evangelicalism? Or is the bigger problem learned intellectual disability?** _[See note below]_



  * Why is Richard standing on his head?



  * Is James a more faithful witness when he is quoting Scripture or answering questions?



  * Is the "You're wasting your time, bro" guy behaving appropriately? Why or why not?



  * Does "God love us all" as Allison believes?  Will everyone be saved if they claim to love God?



  * Should Christians confront people following other gospels, or just let them be?










# Learned intellectual disability





Intellectual disability (ID) is the officially sanctioned term.  But widespread mental retardation more properly communicates the depth of the problem.  This is not dyslexia.  People with mental retardation are incapable of functioning at the level the average American over 50 would expect of them.

What would you guess the IQ levels of the college students in the video might be, based on their speech and behavior?  Take special note of category B:



## Mental Retardation

A. Significantly subaverage intellectual functioning: an IQ of approximately 70 or below on an individually administered IQ test (for infants, a clinical judgment of significantly subaverage intellectual functioning).

B. Concurrent deficits or impairments in present adaptive functioning (i.e., the person's effectiveness in meeting the standards expected for his or her age by his or her cultural group) in at least two of the following areas: communication, self-care, home living, social/interpersonal skills, use of community resources, self-direction, functional academic skills, work, leisure, health, and safety.

C. The onset is before age 18 years.

_Code_ based on degree of severity reflecting level of intellectual impairment:

Code | Title | Description
--- | --- | ---
317 | Mild Mental Retardation | IQ level 50-55 to approximately 70 
318.0 | Moderate Mental Retardation | IQ level 35-40 to 50-55 
318.1 | Severe Mental Retardation | IQ level 20-25 to 35-40 
318.2 | Profound Mental Retardation | IQ level below 20 or 25 319 Mental Retardation, Severity Unspecified: when there is strong presumption of Mental Retardation but the person's intelligence is untestable by standard tests

# Prayer





Dear Lord, have mercy on us.  We have neglected the things we ought to have done. Specifically we have failed to raise and nurture the next generation.  Forgive us, Lord.  Guide us.  Protect us.  Deliver us.  Let us be lights in this present evil age.  Through Jesus Christ thy Son our Lord.  _Amen_
