The Reformation is 500 years old this month. Does it matter?

Yesterday I spoke with a friend who had just returned from Berlin.  He visited a large church which advertised an exhibit on the "Lutheran Reformation".  He described it as...

> a bunch of white balls on strings.  We left.

I believe "white balls on strings" has as much meaning as the words "Lutheran Reformation" to many Evangelicals.  

Martin Luther and the Reformers and Stephen and Peter and Paul and the Apostles had a *love of the truth*.  Is "love of the truth" alive in alive in your local congregation?  Is it alive in you?

Dear Lord, protect your sheep.  Give us that love of the truth that lived inside brother Martin.  In Jesus' name.  Amen.


## Lyrics *The Son of God Goes Forth to War* by Reginald Heber

|  1. The Son of God goes forth to war
|     A kingly crown to gain.
|     His blood-red banner streams afar;
|     Who follows in His train?
|     Who best can drink His cup of woe,
|     Triumphant over pain,
|     Who patient bears his cross below--
|     He follows in His train.
|
|  2. The martyr first whose eagle eye
|     Could pierce beyond the grave,
|     Who saw His Master in the sky
|     And called on Him to save.
|     Like Him, with pardon on His tongue,
|     In midst of mortal pain,
|     He prayed for them that did the wrong--
|     Who follows in his train?
|
|  3. A glorious band, the chosen few,
|     On whom the Spirit came,
|     Twelve valiant saints; their hope they knew
|     And mocked the cross and flame.
|     They met the tyrant's brandished steel,
|     The lion's gory mane;
|     They bowed their necks the death to feel--
|     Who follows in their train?
|
|  4. A noble army, men and boys,
|     The matron and the maid,
|     Around the Savior's throne rejoice,
|     In robes of light arrayed.
|     They climbed the steep ascent of heav'n
|     Thro' peril, toil, and pain.
|     O God, to us may grace be giv'n
|     To follow in their train!
