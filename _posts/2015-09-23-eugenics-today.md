The idea of destroying large groups of people is nothing new.  Stalin killed 20 million.  Mao killed 40 million.  It shouldn’t surprise you that there are people on earth right now who want to kill you.  To a spiritual eugenicist, you are part of a less-evolved humanity which is no longer needed.  You are a burden on the limited resources of the earth.



<blockquote>
  The wicked plotteth against the just, 
     and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.
  The Lord shall laugh at him: 
     for he seeth that his day is coming. 
  The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, [and] to slay such as be of upright conversation. 
  Their sword shall enter into their own heart,
     and their bows shall be broken -Psalm 37.12-15
</blockquote>






# The morality of genocide



There is always a kind of false religion involved in mass murder. Eugenicists and transhumanists have a fanatic drive to advance evolution through science.  Homo Sapiens must yield to Homo Noeticus who will be the true Aryan übermensch.  By definition this means that the old man must make way for the new.



<blockquote>
  The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's heading up to about nine billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, and reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent. - Bill Gates

# Lessons from National Socialism


It's not easy to dispose of great numbers of dead people.





<blockquote>
  The SS men were constantly drinking vodka or cognac or something else from their bottles. They couldn’t cope with it either. It was terrible. -Otto Pressburger, Auschwitz survivor
</blockquote>



Even with the best _improvements_, mass killing is a crude, brutal affair.



<blockquote>
  We had to dig the bodies out and burn them. A big fire was made here with wood and petrol and we were throwing them right into it. There were always two of us throwing the bodies in, one holding the legs and one on the arms. The smell and the stench was terrible. The bodies were not only bloody but rotten as well. We were given some rags to put over our faces. -Ibid
</blockquote>




The soldiers and prisoners tasked with carrying out _mercy killings_ are permanently scarred by their acts.


<blockquote>
  We built our gas chambers to accommodate 2,000 people at one time, whereas at Treblinka their 10 gas chambers only accommodated 200 people each...
  
  We endeavored to fool the victims into thinking that they were to go through a delousing process. Of course, frequently they realized our true intentions and we sometimes had riots and difficulties due to that fact...
  
  The foul and nauseating stench from the continuous burning of bodies permeated the entire area and all of the people living in the surrounding communities knew that exterminations were going on at Auschwitz. -Commandant Rudolf Hoss, sworn Nuremberg testimony.

# Current reality is in alignment with Eugenic Goals

{: .full}


Eugenics theory does not require an obvious approach or quick-kill.  The end goal is the important thing.  There are indications that eugenics continues to be advanced in many different ways throughout the world. For example:



## 1. Growing and widespread infertility



In many countries the fertility rate has dropped below replacement level.  Amongst those who wish to have children, there is a growing need for “treatments” to ensure viable pregnancies.  In war areas, the use of depleted-Uranium weapons is contributing to genetic deformities and high levels of miscarriage and infertility.



## 2. Abortion/infanticide


Abortion is encouraged as a moral good throughout the world.  There have been more than 54 million Americans killed since 1973.



## 3. Shortening of the human lifespan



Chronic diseases such as asthma, diabetes, and obesity are affecting people at higher rates and younger ages.  Influenza viruses and bacterial diseases are becoming more virulent and sometimes resistant to treatment.  Heavy metal poisoning (aluminum, mercury) is harming immune response and nerve function.  Consuming GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) foodstuffs is contributing to malnutrition.



## 4. War



So far the twenty-first century is shaping up to be among the most destructive centuries in recorded human history with large numbers of civilian casualties.



## 5. Drought and famine



Drought and famine is contributing to death and mass refugee movements.  Too many refugees generate instability and mass acceptance of reprehensible policies.



# Corporate value - Continuous Improvement 



If the eugenicists are still with us today, they seem to be learning their lessons well.  For example:



## 1. Plausible deniability



Segmented responsibility and controlled information flow mean the planners are insulated.  At the operational levels, many don't know the real reasons for the things they do.  If they suspect anything, they soothe their consciences by falling back on discipline (_I am just following orders_) or misplaced patriotism (_I am acting for the good of my country_).



## 2. Interlocking purposes



The winnowing of humanity is happening in accordance with other concurrent schemes.  Great profit is made through suffering.  All those feel-good cancer walks and billions of dollars given to research never seem to accomplish much, do they? Have you ever wondered why there are so few cures for chronic illness?  Why are barbaric and expensive treatments (surgery-radiation-chemotherapy) the only ones acceptable when a loved one gets cancer?



# Conclusion: hiding in plain sight



The horror of it all makes it hard to face the evidence in front of us.  We can accept that _those people over there_ would murder their own citizens.  We can believe that Pharoah would want to exterminate the Hebrews.  We can even believe that the Muslims might try to kill or enslave Christians in the Middle Ages.  But we can’t believe living American and European elites would put plans in place to purge people in a systematic, methodical and technological way.

The refusal of many to contemplate this obvious part of 21st Century reality makes it inevitable that the eugenicists will continue to operate freely and openly, and many more humans will continue to die.


*Though the cause of evil prosper, yet the truth alone is strong...
Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above His own.*
