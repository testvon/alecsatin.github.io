Some people think of *testimony* as limited to one's Christian life story.  But how a person behaves in a situation is also a testimony of who they are and what they believe.  A post on [Doug's (Asleep no more)](http://wideawakechristian.blogspot.ca/2017/05/random-bits_19.html) refers to a news item about what happened when two teenagers peacefully witnessed to Christ outside of a high school in Downington, Pennsylvania. The testimony of the Assistant Principal of the school, Dr. Zachary Ruff, has been captured on video below.

Some observations:


## 1. Christians are here on earth in 2017 to bear witness to the salvation of Jesus Christ.  

These 16 year-olds manifest the gifts of the spirit (peace, patience, gentleness, goodness, self-control) in the face of an authority who displays aggression and hatred.  

## 2. Speaking the Word is always used by the Holy Spirit.

Remember the story of Stephen in the book of Acts?  The preaching of the Word by ordinary Christians will harden some listeners and save others.   There are people like Dr. Ruff who cannot bear to hear even a bit of God's law, much less his gospel. 

- At 5 minutes 28 seconds (5m28s) he physically grabs the young man's sign.
- At 7m29s he says, *This is a public school.  We don't believe in that here.*
- At 1m10s he says to the young man, *You can go to hell.*

## 3. Dr. Ruff seems to consider the open display of Christianity as harassment.

He says, *This is not the time or the place for you to harass innocent schoolchildren...They have nothing to do with your twisted and perverted agenda*.

## 4. This public school assistant principal does not believe Christians have the right of free speech.  

Note that these young people were on a public sidewalk.  Dr. Ruff makes these statements:

- *You do not have the permission to talk*  
- *You cannot talk to my students.  You will not do it while I am here.*

## 5. Ruff uses threat of legal punishment to silence.

- *I will call the police (on you) for trespassing* 0m40s
- *I will call the police (on you) __for harassing me__* 2m20s

## 6. Dr. Ruff clearly has an agenda against the students' religion.

- He uses his voice and body to block and yell over the teens.  You can see this at 11m38s. 
- He gets particularly angry at 13m15s when one of the 16 year olds says, *Jesus Christ can set you free*, replying 
- *I'm as gay as the day is long and twice as sunny and I don't give a f--- what you think Jesus is trying to tell me.*

## 7. Two adults come to the young people's aid.

- One man - at 6m07s - jumps out of his car, saying, *Those kids have the right to be there.*  Ruff threatens to call the police.
- At 8m43s One teacher says to the principal, *Make good choices*.

> Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.  Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.  Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. -Matthew 5:14-16

# Prayer

Dear Lord, have mercy.  You are the way, the truth, and the life.  No one gets to heaven except by you.  Forgive us for hiding our light under bushel-baskets.  Manifest peace, patience, gentleness, goodness, and self-control in us, your people.  Show us how to shine.  Through Jesus Christ, your Son, our Lord.  Amen
