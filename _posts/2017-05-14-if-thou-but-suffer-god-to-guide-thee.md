## "If Thou But Suffer God to Guide Thee"
by Georg Neumark, 1621-1681
Translated by Catherine Winkworth, 1829-1878

1. If thou but suffer God to guide thee  
And hope in Him through all thy ways,  
He'll give thee strength, whate'er betide thee,  
And bear thee through the evil days.  
Who trusts in God's unchanging love  
Builds on the Rock that naught can move.  

2. What can these anxious cares avail thee,  
These never-ceasing moans and sighs?  
What can it help if thou bewail thee  
O'er each dark moment as it flies?  
Our cross and trials do but press  
The heavier for our bitterness.  

3. Be patient and await His leisure  
In cheerful hope, with heart content  
To take whate'er thy Father's pleasure  
And His discerning love hath sent,  
Nor doubt our inmost wants are known  
To Him who chose us for His own.  

4. God knows full well when times of gladness  
Shall be the needful thing for thee.  
When He has tried thy soul with sadness  
And from all guile has found thee free,  
He comes to thee all unaware  
And makes thee own His loving care.  

5. Nor think amid the fiery trial  
That God hath cast thee off unheard,  
That he whose hopes meet no denial  
Must surely be of God preferred.  
Time passes and much change doth bring  
And sets a bound to everything.  

6. All are alike before the Highest;  
'Tis easy to our God, we know,  
To raise thee up, though low thou liest,  
To make the rich man poor and low.  
True wonders still by Him are wrought  
Who setteth up and brings to naught.  

7. Sing, pray, and keep His ways unswerving,  
Perform thy duties faithfully,  
And trust His Word, though undeserving,  
Thou yet shalt find it true for thee.  
God never yet forsook in need  
The soul that trusted Him indeed.
