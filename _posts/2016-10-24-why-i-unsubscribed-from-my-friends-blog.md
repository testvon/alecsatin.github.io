Dear Mitchell (name changed),

You asked why I unsubscribed after reading your messages for so long.  Over the last year I've steadily stopped following political and economics blogs.  Yours was one of the last remaining.  The material you send is excellent.  I get it.  No further details are needed.  The trajectory to a world ruled by the scientific elites clicks on towards an expected end.

The question that occupies me now is this: how can I best be of use to the people around me? So many in the American state seem to have forgotten history.  They don't "get" the times in which we live.  Rather, the conditioning process has left them confused and distracted.  They seek comfort, relief, and salvation through their identification with a political leader.

# The land of Reds and blues

One group confuses "openness" with "freedom".  "Diversity" is "virtue".  They doubt there is a way to know absolute truth.  But they know absolutely that people who believe in such things are dangerous.

The other side confuses jingoism with patriotism.  They are stomping mad and sure that all will be well as soon as the country is wrested away from those "enemies" and "set back on the right track".  

It's hard to tell which group hates more.  Or is more self-righteous.  Jesus said, "A kingdom divided against itself cannot stand" (Mark 3.24).  

# This demoralized people

Americans are bombarded with behavioral reinforcement both crude and sophisticated, day in, day out.  People are exhausted from overwork, from failing health, from the drugs they take and from the steadily worsening condition of the food, clothing, everyday products and services of their lives.  Frightening circuses and entertainment/news - along with celebrity leaders - fuhrers - provide just enough distraction to keep people chugging along day after day.  

# Christian, stranger

As a Biblical Christian (orthodox, subscribing to the Augsburg Confession and the Book of Concord), I am the outsider in the American empire.  Most all churches have been eaten alive by the corporatism spanning out from Fuller Seminary and from the first, second and third generation disciples of Mr Peter Drucker.  For simple Christians from all denominations who read the Bible frequently, believe it to be without error, and seek to worship God without being part of a purpose-driven "three-legged stool", there are fewer and fewer places to go.  Have you heard of the "Dones"?  A fair number of these are Christians 50 and older who cannot find a place to worship God.  We pray in small groups, connect with each other in various ways, and do the best we can in an increasingly hostile and alien land.

# That spiritual kingdom

Why did I unsubscribe?  Because my nation is lost and there's little point in tracking every curve downward.  Instead, I'm seeking to fill my mind with an understanding of Biblical orthodoxy - Scripture, theology, practice.  There may be young people who come across my path who care to know what Christianity used to be, still is, and always will be.  When and if I meet them, I want to be be ready, with speech seasoned with grace. 

The Lord bless you and keep you, Mitchell, may he shine his face upon you and give you rest, through Jesus Christ, his son, our Lord.  Amen.

Alec
