Matthias Niessner at Stanford shows how a cheap webcam and software can be used to create fake videos of any well-known celebrity or political figure.  

>In simple English: famous "talking heads" speaking, chatting, interacting on TV can be practically anyone masquerading as said celebrity, and due to the real time conversion, they can talk, react, answer questions and generally emote so that the deception is flawless and totally convincing." 

[From the Stanford release](http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/~niessner/thies2016face.html):

<blockquote>Our aim is to demonstrate the capabilities of modern computer vision and graphics technology... computer-generated videos have been part in feature-film movies for over 30 years. **These results are hard to distinguish from reality and it often goes unnoticed that the content is not real.** The novelty and contribution of our work is that we can edit pre-recorded videos in real-time on a commodity PC. </blockquote>
