This medical doctor had no interest in hell until a serious illness plunged him into the experience he relates in the video.

It's not only Christians who think about hell.  Even some popular New Age books on near-death experiences include descriptions of suffering after death.  It’s no wonder such testimonies are seldom discussed.  They're scary.  They contradict the idea that people get a second chance after this life.

Here’s how the Bible describes the afterlife for those without having been justified by Jesus Christ:



<blockquote>
  And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. 24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame...
  
  But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. 26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that [would come] from thence.
  
  Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house: 28 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. -Luke 16
</blockquote>
