This video came from [NYCPastor.com](https://nycpastor.com/2016/07/05/heard-on-the-streets-of-nyc/).  It's quite revealing about the lack of knowledge many young Americans have about Biblical Christianity.  

Pray to the Lord of the harvest for the younger generation, that he would send forth laborers.  For how can they hear without a preacher?

<blockquote>And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd. 

Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few; Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.  (Matthew 9:35-38)</blockquote>
