# Welcome
This website *alecsatin.com* started in 2002 with a focus on counseling psychology.  Just like the character Christian in John Bunyan's *Pilgrim's Progress*, your author has taken long side journeys and brought this website along with him.  Christian was helped back on his path.  And good Christian friends working along with our gracious Lord and his all-powerful Word have have helped me find my faith once again.

From 2015 under the title *While it's yet day* I used the site to record my observations on the state of American society and American evangelicalism.  

# Changes in 2017

## Comfort for Christians
I've been an outsider throughout my life. Depression and anxiety have been with me since childhood.  Throughout my Christian life I've had difficulty fitting in to the Christian world.  It's my suspicion that there are other Christians who suffer alone hiding similar truths behind smiling faces.  My goal is to provide an ongoing resource and place of encouragement to you, whoever and wherever you are, through our common faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.  I'm here as a brother in Christ to support you in your faith.

## Goodbye Wordpress
### Security issues
Over the last year, 3900 IP addresses were banned for trying to hack into my Wordpress site.  Dealing with this is a complete waste of time.  Goodbye Wordpress means saying sayonara to this hassle.

### Speed issues and other distractions
Wordpress is slow.  Caching, plugins, maintenance, all were distractions.  By moving to a static, non-database platform, you should notice a speed advantage.  I'll be able to focus on what I'm trying to say, and not the neediness of the software.

## Where are the pretty pictures?
Images rarely add to the quality of the information a blog such as this one can provide.  You can find pretty pictures everywhere.  The only images here going forward will be those germane to and necessary for the message being conveyed.

## Wordpress likes
That *like button* was a function of automattic and wordpress and so could not come along with us to this new platform.  If you find yourself wanting to *like* a post, please share it using one of the buttons at the end of the post, make a comment, or [drop me a message](/contact/).  It takes a smidgen more effort.  But it makes a bigger impact than a *like* ever could.

## Comments
The new commenting system is active now.  A subscribe to comments feature is in the works.  This will notify you (if you request) when someone replies to a post to which you've made a comment.

## Old posts
The posts from *While it's yet day* have been archived off-line.  As time permits they are being reviewed for tone and content.  Some will be added back here in original or modified form.

If you would like to see a post you remember, even vaguely, [send me a note](/contact/).  I'll see what I can do to bring it back online.
