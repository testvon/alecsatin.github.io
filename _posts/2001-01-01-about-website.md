[Alecsatin.com](http://www.alecsatin.com) launched in 2002.  Over the years [your author](/about/) has taken long journeys off the path, much like the protagonist "Christian" in John Bunyan's *Pilgrim's Progress*.

This site has mirrored some of those detours - through counseling psychology, experiential trance states, and tarot.  For a time the focus was a vocational one, on software project management.  You may well wonder what all these things have in common.  The common thread is my life-long desire to understand why things are the way they are and what we can do to make things better for ourselves and others in the limited time we are here.

In the end, Bunyan's Christian succeeded in his journey through the intercession of his gracious Lord through the helping hands of real people along the way.  In like manner faithful Christian friends acting in accordance with the all-powerful Word continue to be there for me.  

With these words and reflections I hope to be here for you.

# While it's yet day

In 2015 and 2016 the site operated under the title *While it's yet day*.  The 300 or so posts written at that time were an effort to record my observations on American society and the state of Evangelicalism.  

# The thinking behind Comfort for Christians

Throughout my life as an American Christian I've found it difficult to find a place in the "organized" church.  Introverted, private, a sometime-loner, and having lost many of my family and friends to that great curse which afflicts all mankind (physical death), it's my suspicion that there are other Christians who suffer privately and quietly in similar ways.   My goal is to provide you with an ongoing resource and place of encouragement.  I'm here as a brother in Christ to support you in your faith.

# Why I left Wordpress for Jekyll

## Security issues
Over the last year, 3900 IP addresses were banned for trying to hack into my Wordpress site.  Dealing with this is a complete waste of time.  Goodbye Wordpress means saying sayonara to this hassle.

## Speed issues and other distractions
Wordpress is slow.  Caching, plugins, maintenance, all were distractions.  By moving to a static, non-database platform, you should notice a speed advantage.  I'll be able to focus on what I'm trying to say, and not the neediness of the software.

## Where are the pretty pictures?
Images rarely add to the quality of the information a blog such as this one can provide.  You can find pretty pictures everywhere.  The only images here going forward will be those germane to and necessary for the message being conveyed.

## Wordpress likes
That *like button* was a function of automattic and wordpress and so could not come along with us to this new platform.  If you find yourself wanting to *like* a post, please share it using one of the buttons at the end of the post, make a comment, or [drop me a message](/contact/).  It takes a smidgen more effort.  But it makes a bigger impact than a *like* ever could.

## Comments
The new commenting system is active now.  A subscribe to comments feature is in the works.  This will notify you (if you request) when someone replies to a post to which you've made a comment.

## Old posts
The posts from *While it's yet day* have been archived off-line.  As time permits they are being reviewed for tone and content.  Some will be added back here in original or modified form.

If you would like to see a post you remember, even vaguely, [send me a note](/contact/).  I'll see what I can do to bring it back online.

# A word about politics
The post from 2016, [Why I unsubscribed from my friend's blog](/memoirs/why-i-unsubscribed-from-my-friends-blog/), captured some of my reasons for stepping away from politics.  My thinking is still developing, but any writings along those lines will be framed from a larger historical perspective and may be found under the category [spirit of the age](/spirit-of-the-age/).  This should enable us (I hope) to be able to consider the issues as Christian citizens of that heavenly kingdom with a minimum of rancor and division.

It's my opinion that **Left** and **Right** as they are presently construed have little overlap with **Classical Liberalism** or **Traditional Conservatism**.  Programmed words like **red state**, **blue state**, **Republican**, and **Democrat** are like teams one joins or hates.  Overweening self-righteousness, jingoism, and do-goodism are a heady mix.  And those who have or desire power love to utilize such energies for their own ends.  Let them.  For you and I, let us render to Caesar the things that be Caesar's and render to God the things that be God's (Mark 12:17).
