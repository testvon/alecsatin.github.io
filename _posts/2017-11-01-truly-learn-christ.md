A brief devotion from the 1877 version of Carl Bogatzky's *Golden Treasury for the Children of God*


>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye love one another. John 13:35. 

"God is love; and every one that loveth is born of God;" if we love one another as brethren in Christ, and love all saints as such, not because they are of this or that party; and, if we love not in word only, but in deed, and show the truth of our love by works and labors of love; this is a solid proof to ourselves and to others that we are real disciples of Jesus. It is a clear testimony that we have truly learned Christ, and that we have his Spirit and his love shed abroad in our hearts; that we are of the household of faith, and shall enjoy all the privileges ensured to that happy community. This is a better evidence, and more convincing to all around us, of what we are, than all knowledge, gifts, attainments, and outward privileges whatever. 

God of love, cause me to love thee, and all thine, the poor, the weak, and the feeble, as well as the strong, for all are thine. To this end shed abroad thy own love in my heart, more fully and more powerfully than I have ever experienced it yet. Thou art love, make me loving, so shall I be like thee, and bring honor to thy cause and name. 

```
  O let thy love our hearts constrain,
    Jesus the crucified!
  What hast thou done our hearts to gain?
    Languish'd, and groan'd, and died!
  
  Each one by thy example draw,
    And mutual love impart;
  Let kindness sweetly write her law
    Deep in each grateful heart.
```

â€“ Bogatzky, Carl. *Golden Treasury*. "October 13"
