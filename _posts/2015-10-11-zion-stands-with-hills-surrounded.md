Let's go back a half century to a different time in History, 1960.  The new nation of Israel is 12 years old.  George Beverly Shea releases this record album.  Christians throughout the world see the hand of God working in the restoration of the Jews to their land after 1900 years of exile and the horrors of the Nazi holocaust.



It's a shame that this beautiful hymn is associated now only with the false gospel of the Mormon church.  It's a great Christian hymn which describes the love and protection God offers to His people - Jewish and Gentile alike - who are united by faith in the Son of God, Jesus Christ.

This hymn is only 3 minutes long.  The recording above includes other songs following.

May God richly bless you and keep you, and watch over you, and give you rest.  Amen.

## Lyrics



1 Zion stands by hills surrounded,
Zion, kept by pow’r divine;
All her foes shall be confounded,
Though the world in arms combine;
Happy Zion, what a favored lot is thine!

2 Every human tie may perish;
Friend to friend unfaithful prove;
Mothers cease their own to cherish;
Heav’n and earth at last remove;
But no changes can attend Jehovah’s love.

3 In the furnace God may prove thee,
Thence to bring thee forth more bright,
But can never cease to love thee;
Thou art precious in His sight;
God is with thee—God, thine everlasting Light.

The Lutheran Hymnal
