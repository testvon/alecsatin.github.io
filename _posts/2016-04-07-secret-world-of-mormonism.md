The Mormon church may look Christian and promote good old American values, but the reality is something else again.

Mormon teachings include:





  * Polygamy


  * The superiority of the white race


  * Jesus and Lucifer are brothers


  * God lives on a faraway planet having sex with many wives


  * Spirit babies inhabit the bodies of humans



And the terrible doctrine of



  * Blood atonement/Avenging angels - where a person must give his life for a sin for which Jesus cannot atone.



Are these Biblical doctrines?  Followers of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young say they are.
