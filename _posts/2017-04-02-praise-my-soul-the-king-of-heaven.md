As if it weren't enough to have forgiveness and salvation, God promises to love us to the same degree and in the same measure as his only begotten son, the Lord Jesus Christ.  As 1 Peter 5:7 says, 

> Cast all your cares upon him; for he cares for you. 

To some people this is easy to believe.  But I've never found it that way.  Yet slowly, steadily, God's helping me to understand how he really is:  *Slow to chide and swift to bless.*

In this song Henry Francis Lyte reminds us that God is a father who never fails, never errs, and always provides for us knowing *our feeble frame*.  And yet he treats us with kindness, goodness, and love, with blessings besides.  

He shows us only the love that we are able to bear.  Oh, praise him!

## Lyrics



1 Praise, my soul, the King of heaven;  
to his feet your tribute bring.  
Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,  
evermore his praises sing.  
Alleluia, alleluia!  
Praise the everlasting King!  
  
2 Praise him for his grace and favor  
to his people in distress.  
Praise him, still the same as ever,  
slow to chide, and swift to bless.  
Alleluia, alleluia!  
Glorious in his faithfulness!  
  
3 Fatherlike he tends and spares us;  
well our feeble frame he knows.  
In his hand he gently bears us,  
rescues us from all our foes.  
Alleluia, alleluia!  
Widely yet his mercy flows!  
  
4 Angels, help us to adore him;  
you behold him face to face.  
Sun and moon, bow down before him,  
dwellers all in time and space.  
Alleluia, alleluia!  
Praise with us the God of grace!  

Psalter Hymnal, (Gray)
