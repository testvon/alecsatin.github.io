It’s not so difficult to erase a man these days.  If you don’t believe me, ask some of the thousands of people in the US and Europe who used to listen to the _News in Focus_ program.  Not only was Trevor Hammack’s full body of work scrubbed from the internet, but the man himself left his ministry, closed or abandoned his social media and online accounts, and gave no explanation for what happened.  The few online queries posted about him were met with cowardly and unsubstantiated ad hominem attacks - criticisms of the man, not the content of his message.



## If Pastor Trevor Hammack fell into sin


A separation needs to be made between what disqualifies a man from being a pastor, and what eliminates a man's credibility as a journalist.  If a minister commits adultery, and this is a proven case, then the man should step down as a pastor.

I don't know that this is the case with Trevor Hammack.  

However, if Pastor Hammack fell into some sinful behavior that disqualified him from ministry like Mark Driscoll or Billy Graham’s grandson Tullian Tchividjian, why would that require all his messages to be removed?  Hammack was a consistently evangelical minister who had been syndicated since July 7, 2000.  If he or his teachings were so wrong, wouldn’t someone have noticed in 14 years?

On the contrary, many Christians continue to express sadness at the loss of those messages.

If they were so wrong as to require deletion for all time, shouldn’t there be some warning or explanation given to the flock to protect them from _what they’ve already heard in more than 3083 messages_?

## Trevor Hammack - the man



Trevor Hammack was not a fly-by-night operator.  He was not a hateful bigot.  He was thoughtful and presented facts from the real world with relevant faith-based commentary.  Lots of people listened to and liked him.  They were perplexed and uncomprehending when he just disappeared.

Pastor Hammack was a normal human being with a physical condition (epilepsy) who was trying to live his Christian life and understand the world around him.  **At times he and his family were openly persecuted for their faith**.  In one program he became openly emotional on the air when he spoke of cruelty that had been directed at his little daughter because of something he had said.

He must have said something this time to really get someone angry at him.  Was it one of his last sermons - perhaps the one on American drones - [When robots can kill](http://www.sermonaudio.com/sermoninfo.asp?SID=3211416553710)? Or weather modification - [Discerning the weather](http://www.sermonaudio.com/sermoninfo.asp?SID=413141710574)? Or vaccination - [Flu drug does not work](http://www.sermonaudio.com/sermoninfo.asp?SID=41014126375)?


## Very brief American history



Maybe in history class you heard about the outrage of a previous generation of Americans when, in the 1930's, they learned of book-burnings in Germany.

News elimination is so much easier now.  It’s clean, neat, antiseptic and going on all around you without any debate whatsoever.  

That noise you don’t hear?  It’s the foundations of your society being erased.  And once gone, who will have the knowledge, strength and power to restore them?



<blockquote>
  If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do? -Psalm 11.3
