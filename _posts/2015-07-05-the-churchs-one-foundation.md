_The Church's One Foundation_ was written in response to a serious heresy which surfaced in South Africa in the 1860's.  The hymn writer Samuel Stone patterned his verse on the phrase _The holy Catholic church, the communion of saints_ found in the Apostles' Creed.

Be strengthened today in the knowledge that God Himself still chooses people from every nation.

This version is sung by St.Andrew's Church, Egmore, Chennai, Tamil Nadu , India.
