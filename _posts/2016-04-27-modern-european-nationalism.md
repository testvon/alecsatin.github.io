At the original Tower of Babel human language and society were cursed.  Cunning leaders sought “to make a name” (Gen 11.4) by uniting the world as one.  Their descendants today consciously deny the will and authority of God in separating the nations.  They want nothing less than their children at the helm of the world for a thousand years.

There are others who respect the reality of history.  They understand that efforts at world empire go against the way human beings interact and must result in immense suffering and death.  They may not understand that this is the result of God’s curse. But they “get it” nonetheless.

_And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper? And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground._ -Genesis 4.9-10

History leaves footprints which can be ignored and even forgotten, but never erased.  If you've ever wondered what's going in UK and on the Continent, close attention to this short song will fill in many gaps in your education.  The pieces are already in place.  And Mohammad is not the only enemy in this fight.

Lord, have mercy.

_What's past is prologue_ -Shakespeare, Tempest, Act II, Scene 1

## Lyrics



From Agincourt to Waterloo, Poitiers and then Anjou, The Roses' War, The Hundred years, through battlefields of blood and tears.

From Bosworth field to pointe Du Hoc, Stalingrad and the siege of York, the bloody turf of Gallipoli had no effect on the killing spree.

Bannockburn to Austerlitz, the fall of France and the German Blitz, the cruelest of atrocities, Europa's blood is borne of these.

Heaven help in all our battles, Heaven see love, Heaven help us.

Bolsheviks and feudal lords, chivalry to civil wars, fascist rule and genocide, now we face the rising tide.

Of new crusades, religious wars, insurgents imported to our shores, the western world gripped in fear, the mother of all battles here.

Avant hier, avons etre, deja demain (nous) sommes eclairee.

All glory, all honor, victory is upon us. Our savior fight evil, send armies to defend us.

Empires built and nations burned, mass graves remain unturned. Descendents of the dispossessed return with bombs strapped to their chests.

There's hate for life and death in hate emerging from the new caliphate, the victors of this war on fear will rule for the next thousand years.

Leningrad, Berlin Wall, march on Rome, Bzyantium's fall, lightning war, Dresden night, drop the bomb, end this fight,

Never again.

Europa, Europa, find better days before us, in kindness, in spirit, lead us to a greater calling.
