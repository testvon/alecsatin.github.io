*A Summary of the Christian Faith* was published in 1905.  Dr. Jacobs intended this to be a Biblical, orthodox, and insofar as it was possible, a non-sectarian treatment of the most important aspects of Christianity.  This book was written for everyday Christians. Each chapter of this book contains rich nuggets to strengthen faith.
