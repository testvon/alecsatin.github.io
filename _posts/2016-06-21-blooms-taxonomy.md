Bloom's taxonomy of higher education [from this post](https://ichabodthegloryhasdeparted.blogspot.com/2016/06/what-happened-to-independent-thinking.html) provides quite a good model for understanding the state of things in the wider culture.

A taxonomy is just a method for classifying different things, like one of those old accordion files with pockets for each month that people used to use to save their expense receipts for the end of the year.

Bloom created the chart to help students write better research papers.[^14901340]  But a few minutes thinking about it now, and saving it to refer to later, may be helpful to you in understanding some of the otherwise incomprehensible conversations you may find yourself having with others in your church, at work, or online.

[^14901340]: "The Bloom chart is used to get students off papers like this – I am going to write about this, and this, and this, simply quoting the textbook. Remembering in Bloom means repeat after me what was just taught." -Greg Jackson, private correspondence



# American education is the most successful in the world





The point of the _American public education cartel_[^eec38ed4] is to prepare the next generation to be productive, obedient members of the new society.  This is not a debatable issue.  The facts are so obvious and clear that only a person intentionally lying or too afraid to face the facts could see things any other way.  People on the left like [John Taylor Gatto](https://archive.org/details/TheUndergroundHistoryOfAmericanEducation_758) in his _Underground history of American education_ and on the right like [Charlotte Thomson Iserbyt](http://www.deliberatedumbingdown.com/) in her _The deliberate dumbing down of America_ have written brilliant, detailed and comprehensive descriptions of how the process works and why it was established.  Scary?  Yes.  Important for you to understand?  No.  Not important.  Essential.

[^eec38ed4]: Cartel: [German kartell, literally, written agreement between opposing belligerents, from French cartel, literally, letter of defiance] : a voluntary often international combination of independent private enterprises supplying like commodities or services that agree to limit their competitive activities (as by allocating customers or markets, regulating quantity or quality of output, pooling returns or profits, fixing prices or terms of sale, exchanging techniques, trademarks, or patents, or by other methods of controlling production, price, or distribution) -Websters Third Unabridged

Much frustration and hand-wringing on the part of Christians and other well-meaning people comes from their profound misunderstanding of the reality of the times.  Specifically _the inability of many younger Americans to think rationally_.  And the _rabid anti-Christian attitudes of those younger Americans who can_.  Even, and especially, in the churches.



# Remembering





The very bottom level of Bloom's chart is termed _Remembering_.  This is the regurgitation of catchwords, phrases and talking points.  There is no internal processing or assessment of what's been stuffed in the mind.  Another word for this is _parroting_.

There are two crucial things to keep in mind.  Facts need to be assessed as to quality.  [Garbage in - garbage out](http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-gar1.htm) in this context means that the thinking of people is only as good as the quality of the facts they've been given.  Misleading data - or too much disconnected stuff - will create perfect little citizens who think they are behaving independently as individuals, but to a large degree are following intelligently designed programming which has been inserted into them from their earliest years.  [Most American education begins at age 3 or younger](http://www.webmd.com/parenting/features/my-child-ready-preschool) these days.



# It all comes together





We are moving closer to a sea-change.  The America, or Britain, or world that you think you are still living in is already over.  It has to be, _because the next generations do not have any loyalty or respect for the ideas which established and maintained that world_.

Think of the general ignorance of the Bible, and of events of the twentieth century.  Even of 9-11.  This a-historicism - the tendency to disregard history as unimportant - grows with each succeeding wave of graduates.  The ground is ripe for a terrible totalitarianism.  The seeds have sprouted.  Young trees are growing.

This ties in to so many things - the redefinition of words as per [Orwell](/spirit-of-the-age/what-orwellian-means/), the wholesale [normalization of drugging as per Huxley](/spirit-of-the-age/behaviorism-and-social-conditioning/), the post-modernist destruction of the idea of truth as a viable model for thought, Derrida's deconstructionism which removes the ability of people to understand the written word, etc.

For those of you fortunate enough to have been spared the mental corruption of Derrida, he's in large part responsible for the idea that a book's meaning is what the reader intends - not the author.  You understand of course that a person _mis-educated_ into this way of thinking will never accept the clear words of Scripture as you do.[^5c0dd5e0]

[^5c0dd5e0]: Of course it's only the Holy Spirit who enables anyone to understand God's word.  Nevertheless, a crippled mind _which rejects the very concept of absolute truth_ has become a hardened field.  Can God save such a person?  Of course.  But what will it be like to be surrounded by people who think you're a mad, maybe even dangerous lunatic for even conceiving of black and white truth as a possibility?  _Just look around you_.  That world is now.



# Outside the church





Outside the church, the society has undergone a series of revolutions.  The norms and values of people in their 60's and 70's and older are almost completely disregarded by the younger generations.  Americans had previously been raised with a shared cultural norm which is now an empty husk, sucked dry from the inside out like a dead fly in a spider's web.  The elders are speaking at work, through technology and online.  But no one's listening.  Those coming of age justify their angry superiority on the basis of, "the mess those privileged ones have made of the world".



# Inside the churches





Inside the church it's not much different.  God still saves, and there are still many believers, thank God.  But the fish is rotting from the head of the visible churches down, as per the Chinese proverb. Not only [don't professing Christians know the Bible](/biblical-orthodoxy/jesus-hermeneutic/), [they reject what they don't like](/ever-wonder/how-much-of-the-new-testament-was-written-by-paul/).



# Digital mobs and the Outrage machine





All of this is easily manipulated by the power-mad, who by definition are at war with Jesus Christ.  A friend of mine sent this.  You might find it relevant to recent situations you or other Christians you know have experienced.  Would love to hear what you think, if you decide to spend the 10 minutes to view the New York Times report:

# Encouragement





God be with you.  Stand strong!  Your brother in Christ Steve reminded me of these words:



<blockquote>Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
**_Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you._** (Matthew 5.3-12) </blockquote>



Dear Lord, how far above our ways are your ways.  Help us with all our getting, to get wisdom, and with that wisdom, to get understanding.  Do good to them who persecute and despitefully use us.  Teach us to stand strong, yet humble, firm yet loving.  Make us true children of you, our Father in heaven, praised be your name.  Through Jesus Christ, thy son, our Lord.  _Amen_
