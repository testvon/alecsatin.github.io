[The following devotion is from Bogatzky's *Golden Treasury*]

>The Lord is not 'far from every one of us; for in him we live, and move, and have our being.' Acts 17:27, 28.
>Even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Luke 12:7. 

How close and tender the love which the Lord bears to his people! Nothing is so mean as to be overlooked by the providence pf God; and scarcely anything is so minute as not to be capable of either injuring or profiting the soul. How sweet is it to observe the Divine footsteps, even in the least considerable affairs, and to be satisfied that we may trust every concern in the Divine hands! Lord, grant that I may never swerve from thee, nor do anything without thee; but that, in going in and out, I may always have respect to thy presence, as if I had to do with none but thee. that I could transact all my affairs as if with thee alone, and in all places look upon thee as my Observer and Friend? Let me carefully mark the inward workings of thy grace, and the outward tokens of thy providence, so as daily to have a true sense of thy gracious presence in everything, whether more or less important; and thereby to be strengthened in faith, and kept in a composed state of mind; considering that nothing happens by mere chance, but that all is wisely ordered by thy providential care for our good; firmly believing, if anything goes contrary to expectation that some benefit will accrue from it, if I be but patient and resigned. Lord, give me resignation, and produce in me entire acquiescence in thy wise, holy, and gracious will. 

â€“ Bogatzky, Carl. *Golden Treasury*. "November 19"
