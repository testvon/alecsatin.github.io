The following account is taken from *Foxe’s book of Martyrs*, The Ninth Persecution Under Aurelian, (commencing) A.D. 274
{: .notice}

In the year of Christ 286, a most remarkable affair occurred; a legion of soldiers, consisting of six thousand six hundred and sixty-six men, contained none but Christians. This legion was called the Theban Legion, because the men had been raised in Thebias: they were quartered in the east until the emperor Maximian ordered them to march to Gaul, to assist him against the rebels of Burgundy. They passed the Alps into Gaul, under the command of Mauritius, Candidus, and Exupernis, their worthy commanders, and at length joined the emperor.

Maximian, about this time, ordered a general sacrifice, at which the whole army was to assist; and likewise he commanded that they should take the oath of allegiance and swear, at the saame time, to assist in the extirpation of Christianity in Gaul.

Alarmed at these orders, **each individual of the Theban Legion absolutely refused either to sacrifice or take the oaths prescribed. This so greatly enraged Maximian, that he ordered the legion to be decimated,** that is, every tenth man to be selected from the rest, and put to the sword.

This bloody order having been put in execution, those who remained alive were still inflexible, when a second decimation took place, and every tenth man of those living was put to death. This second severity made no more impression than the first had done; the soldiers preserved their fortitude and their principles, but by the advice of their officers they drew up a loyal remonstrance to the emperor.

This, it might have been presumed, would have softened the emperor, but it had a contrary effect: for, **enraged at their perseverance and unanimity, he commanded that the whole legion should be put to death, which was accordingly executed by the other troops, who cut them to pieces with their swords, September 22, 286.**



_Thank you dear Lord for the example of these brave men.  May you grant everyone reading these words faith to believe, and having believed, to stand.  Prepare us and help us in these challenging days to conduct ourselves that we will have no shame when we stand before you on that great day.  In Christ’s name and for His sake, Amen._
