After witnessing yet another series of "attack posts" by professing Christians who make no pretense of behaving decently, I've again started to question the issue of comments.  Once an apostate (_fallen-away or falsely professing_) Christian has displayed bold rejection of the faith,  why would we give them a platform to spew their poison?  Isn't this sin on our part?



<blockquote>
  But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
  A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition reject;
  Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself. (Titus 3:9-11)
</blockquote>





Let me be clear that I am not referring to athiests or internet trolls.  My question has to do with professing Christians who:





  * Diminish Scripture, 


  * Deny the Trinity, or,


  * Reject Justification by Faith.



These things strike at the heart of Christianity.



# Example




This commenter [hates](http://extranos.blogspot.com/2016/01/hitler-loses-univeral-objective.html) the doctrine of Justification by Faith.  He displays open disrespect towards orthodox Lutherans including practicing ministers of the gospel.  Treating him as a fellow Christian, I attempt to call attention to his inappropriate behavior in a respectful way.



<blockquote>
Don Vega,

Do you believe that people who reject UOJ are your brothers in Christ?

I ask this because as someone new to Lutheranism, the carte blanche rejection of 1 Timothy 5 in the discussion of this issue is startling.

Of course, if UOJ people do not believe Justification by Faith alone Lutherans are brothers, then the behavior makes sense.

Hope you will answer me.

His response is startling.

    It would depend on your definition of 'brother'. I could not be in fellowship with one who denies objective justification. I would not be able to commune with him. Since I can not commune with him, I would not consider him a brother. That is not to say that there are not true believers who will be in Heaven from across all denominations.

    I do not understand how 1 Tim. 5 bears credence to the discussion.

    Gregory Jackson should on the other hand recant his false accusations regarding Robt. Preus as I have shown here that he is in error.

    The problems with him and Mr. Lito are this: They view that people ais violentlyre saved because of their faith and not through faith by grace for the sake of Christ. There is a difference and I hope you are able to see it.

This commenter truly believes that anyone who does not share his aberrant belief is following a different gospel.  And for those who are not Confessional Lutherans, the Book of Concord is clear that justification is by faith alone, through grace alone, by Jesus Christ alone.  

Don Vega wants to evangelize you, me, and everyone else into his apostasy.


_Dear Lord,  please protect us form apostates and lead us into all truth.  May we be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.  Through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Amen_

Note: this post has been shortened from its original form.  Specifically, comments about Josh have been removed.  He and I were able to reach an understanding, thanks be to God who loves peace between brethren.
