## Sometime. 

|   Sometime, when all life's lessons have been learned, 
|     And sun and stars forevermore have set, 
|   The things which our weak judgment here have spurned, 
|     The things o'er which we grieved with lashes wet. 
|   Will flash before us, out of life's dark night. 
|     As stars shine more in deeper tints of blue. 
|   And we shall see how all God's plans were right, 
|     And how what seemed reproof was love most true. 
|   
|   And we shall see how, while we frown and sigh, 
|     God's plans go on as best for you and me; 
|   How, when we called, He heeded not our cry, 
|     Because His wisdom to the end could see. 
|   And even as prudent parents disallow 
|     Too much of sweet to craving babyhood. 
|   So God, perhaps, is keeping from us now, 
|     Life's sweetest things, because it seemeth good. 
|   
|   And if, sometimes, commingled with life's wine. 
|     We find the wormwood and rebel and shrink. 
|   Be sure a wiser hand than yours or mine. 
|     Pours out this potion for our lips to drink. 
|   And if some friend we love is lying low, 
|     Where human kisses cannot reach his face, 
|   Oh, do not blame the loving Father so, 
|     But wear your sorrow with obedient grace. 
|   
|   And you shall shortly know that lengthened breath 
|     Is not the sweetest gift God sends His friend. 
|   And that sometimes the sable pall of death 
|     Conceals the fairest boon His love can send. 
|   If we could push ajar the gates of life 
|     And stand within, and all God's workings see, 
|   We could interpret all this doubt and strife, 
|     And for each mystery would find a key. 
|   
|   But not today, then be content, poor heart!
|     God's plans, like lilies, pure and white unfold, 
|   We must not tear the close shut leaves apart; 
|     Time will reveal the hidden cups of gold. 
|   And if, through patient toil, we reach the land 
|     Where weary feet, with sandals loose, may rest, 
|   Then we shall know and clearly understand – 
|     I think that we shall say, "Our God knew best!" 
|   
|               – M. R. Smith., Quoted by Bishop Huntington
