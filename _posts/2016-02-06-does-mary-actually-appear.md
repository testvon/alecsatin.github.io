# Does Mary actually appear to people?

Richard Bennett:

> I was upon in Yakima, in Washington State, and there was a big billboard where she had supposedly appeared.  
> 
> They say that Mary appears in different places, Texas, Denver, Colorado, and Conyers, Atlanta.
> 
> **Biblical Mary does not appear.**  But things happen.  These are strange places.  If you go there, pray for protection.  They are strange.  I am convinced that they are demonic.
> 
> There are some books you cannot get in Christian bookstores.  *Quite contrary* by Tim Kaufman.  He is a Nasa physicist and a devout Roman Catholic who was into the apparitions and he got convicted and saved.  He wrote two books and man does he explain it.  He explains the exact words and the happenings.

# Selected quotes from the video


## Council of Trent curse on the gospel
_This (the Council of Trent) is where the Catholic Church put an official curse on the gospel.  If anyone believes you are saved by grace through faith, you are eternally damned._

## Where the apocryphal books came from
_These (apocryphal books) came in during the inter-testamental period. They were never accepted by the Jews.  They were never accepted by the believers.  The only one who struggled over it was Jerome. No one ever accepted them.  It was at the time of the Reformation that the Roman Catholic Church wanted them and said they were part of the Bible._

# Gregory the Great
_Gregory the Great said, "If anyone calls himself the bishop of the whole church, he is the anti-christ".  It was only in the eighth century that the Catholic Church claimed "Bishop over all bishops"._

# Christ is the rock
_The early church understood that the rock (not Peter) was Christ.  The early traditions obliterate their claim._
