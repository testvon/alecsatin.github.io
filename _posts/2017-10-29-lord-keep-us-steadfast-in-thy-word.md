Here is William Lee Hunton's description of this justly famous hymn, *Lord, Keep Us Steadfast in Thy Word*

>The origin and the content of this hymn emphasize its meaning and value. Rome boasts that she never changes; the Turk has not improved, new and diverse enemies have risen round about us, so that there are numerous occasions when sincere Christians, realizing their environment, can enter with appreciation into the singing of this old Luther hymn, recognizing that though some conditions vary, the real dangers are the same, and the need of every influence and protection and guidance of the Triune God prayed for in this remarkable Luther hymn is needed today and every day that the Christian lives. 
>
>This hymn is found in all good Lutheran hymn books; it is included in the new "Common Service Book with Hymnal" for all English-speaking Lutherans; it is a universal favorite in German churches. Written primarily for the children to sing, it has become a general favorite of devout, believing Christians who find it a most expressive prayer, breathing their innermost feelings as to the necessity of the restraints which only God can throw around the enemies of truth and the protection which only God can give to all Christians. It is, therefore, a prayer for continuance in the word as a safe tower of defense.[^aha]

## Lyrics *Lord, Keep us Steadfast in Thy Word* by Martin Luther

<pre>
  by Martin Luther, 1483-1546
  
  1. Lord, keep us steadfast in Thy Word;
  Curb those who fain by craft and sword
  Would wrest the Kingdom from Thy Son
  And set at naught all He hath done.
  
  2. Lord Jesus Christ, Thy power make known,
  For Thou art Lord of lords alone;
  Defend Thy Christendom that we
  May evermore sing praise to Thee.
  
  3. O Comforter of priceless worth.
  Send peace and unity on earth.
  Support us in our final strife
  And lead us out of death to life.
