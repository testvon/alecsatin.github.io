## Available Now from the Lutheran Library

B101. *Under Two Captains: The Spiritual Autobiography of Colonel John Jacob Lehmanowsky* 

>Jewish believer in Jesus Christ and faithful Lutheran. Colonel in the army of Napoleon. Friend of Lafayette and the American statesman Henry Clay.  Immigrant to America.  Participant in the Westward migration.  

B102. *Theodore Emanuel Schmauk A Biographical Sketch* by George W. Sandt 

>There is no man in our Church whose Christian consecration has been more evident, whose deep loyalty to the Church has been stronger, whose full participation in her thought and activity has been wider, whose counsel has been more constantly sought and given, whose influence has been more powerful and helpful than that of Dr. Schmauk. –Dr. Knubel, *The Lutheran* 

D103. *New Testament Conversions* by George Henry Gerberding

>Why, a book of sermons on conversion? Because not all that has been written and preached on the subject is truth. Much of it is the saddest and most dangerous caricature of truth. Few subjects have been more abused, misrepresented and misunderstood. A veritable flood of ruinous error has emanated from pen and pulpit on this subject. A sad wreckage of doubt, gloom, skepticism, despair, insanity and self-destruction is the result. Much of the current twaddle is the shallowest sentimentalism or the wildest fanaticism, with all the various baseless gradations be tween. It tends to confuse the mind, to harden the heart, to quench the spirit, to ruin the soul. -G H Gerberding, from the Introduction
