## Available Now from the Lutheran Library

B101. *Under Two Captains: The Autobiography of Colonel John Jacob Lehmanowsky* 

>Jewish believer in Jesus Christ and faithful Lutheran. Colonel in the army of Napoleon. Friend of Lafayette and the American statesman Henry Clay.  Immigrant to America.  Participant in the Westward migration.  

B102. *Theodore Emanuel Schmauk A Biographical Sketch* by George W. Sandt 

>There is no man in our Church whose Christian consecration has been more evident, whose deep loyalty to the Church has been stronger, whose full participation in her thought and activity has been wider, whose counsel has been more constantly sought and given, whose influence has been more powerful and helpful than that of Dr. Schmauk. –Dr. Knubel, *The Lutheran* 

D103. *New Testament Conversions* by George Henry Gerberding

>Why, a book of sermons on conversion? Because not all that has been written and preached on the subject is truth. Much of it is the saddest and most dangerous caricature of truth. Few subjects have been more abused, misrepresented and misunderstood. A veritable flood of ruinous error has emanated from pen and pulpit on this subject. A sad wreckage of doubt, gloom, skepticism, despair, insanity and self-destruction is the result. Much of the current twaddle is the shallowest sentimentalism or the wildest fanaticism, with all the various baseless gradations be tween. It tends to confuse the mind, to harden the heart, to quench the spirit, to ruin the soul. -G H Gerberding, from the Introduction

## Upcoming Fall-Winter 2017

T104 – *The Confessional Principle* by Theodore E. Schmauk

B105 – *Life and Letters of W A Passavant* by George Henry Gerberding

D106 – *Gotthold's Emblems* by Christian Scriber

>His works had entirely disappeared out of the booksellers' shops, when some stray copies of them, almost entirely decayed, and secretly valued by their owners as the legacy of pious ancestors, but generally despised, ridiculed, and rejected, fell into the hands of some Christian and judicious men, who were not deterred from reading and examining them, either by the dust which time had accumulated on their boards, or yet by the partially antiquated language of the contents. They instantly felt that the Spirit of God and of genuine Christianity, breathed out of the sallow pages, – and began to vie with each other, and with his admirers of a bygone age, in praising and applauding the author. – From the Translator's Preface


>"If any clergyman needs a spiritual guide, let him choose Scriver. He is the preacher for preachers, full of consolation and encouragement to the well-meaning, but a storm of hail to the faithless and slothful pastor."

T107 – *The Conservative Reformation and Its Theology* by Charles P. Krauth

T108 – *The Lutheran Country Church* by George H. Gerberding  

>...Someone has said; "If it were not for the stream of fresh, pure, uncontaminated blood flowing into them from the country the cities would rot in their own iniquity." We are sorry to be compelled to believe that this is true. But the good, pure and purifying blood does not all come into the city from the country districts of our own land. Many of the much maligned "foreigners" from the country districts of the old world are a saving salt of no small insignificance. This book wants to help the reader to understand country people and to appreciate the worth of country character. – From The Lutheran Country Church.

T109 – *Summary of the Christian Faith* by Henry Eyster Jacobs
            
T110 – *Infant Baptism and Infant Salvation in Calvinism* by Charles P. Krauth

>There are but two developed systems in the world that claim with any show of probability to be purely Biblical. These systems are the Lutheran and the Calvinistic. They possess a common basis in their recognition of the same rule of faith; their profession of the Old Catholic faith as set forth in the three General Creeds; in their acknowledgment of the doctrine of justification by faith and of its great associated doctrines; and they have vast interests, great stakes, mighty bonds of sympathy in common. No two bodies of Christians have more reason for thoroughly understanding each other than Calvinists and Lutherans have, and no two parts of Christendom are closer together in some vital respects than consistent Calvinism and consistent Lutheranism. It is well worth their while to compare views. – Charles Krauth from *Infant Baptism and Infant Salvation in Calvinism*

T111 – *What's Wrong With the World?* by George H. Gerberding
