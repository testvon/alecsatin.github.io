## Available Now

#### *A Concise Summary of the Lutheran Confessions: Also Known As The Epitome* by Henry Eyster Jacobs. 85 pgs. [117tg]

>Every Christian, according to the guidance of God's Word and his simple Catechism, can distinguish what is right or wrong, where not only the pure doctrine is stated, but also the erroneous contrary doctrine is repudiated and rejected, and thus the controversies, full of causes of offence, that have occurred, are thoroughly settled and decided. 

>May Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus, grant the grace of his Holy Ghost, that we all may be one in him, and constantly abide in this Christian unity, which is well pleasing to him! Amen. 

#### *The Lutheran Country Church* by George H. Gerberding. 145 pgs. [108t]

>...Someone has said; "If it were not for the stream of fresh, pure, uncontaminated blood flowing into them from the country the cities would rot in their own iniquity." We are sorry to be compelled to believe that this is true. But the good, pure and purifying blood does not all come into the city from the country districts of our own land. Many of the much maligned "foreigners" from the country districts of the old world are a saving salt of no small insignificance. This book wants to help the reader to understand country people and to appreciate the worth of country character. – From The Lutheran Country Church.

#### *What's Wrong With the World?* by George H. Gerberding. 117 pgs. [111h]

In this small volume, Dr. Gerberding presents one of the clearest explanations available of the underlying philosophies which led directly to the wars of the Twentieth Century and beyond.

>Since in Adam's fall we sinned all, sin has been in humanity, working through humanity and bringing disaster upon humanity. But sin has been more dominant at some times than at others. Its outbreaks and ravagings have been more widespread and terrific in certain periods and in some places. Sin manifests itself in selfishness. Human selfishness is sin personified. Sometimes and in some places selfishness seems to sway humanity as the trees are swayed by a storm-wind. At such times humanity seems to become inhuman. The milk of human kindness seems to be dried out, reason and clear thinking seem to be ruled out. Calm, deliberate, righteous decision is absent. The basest and the wildest passions are let loose. Mercy weeps in solitude. Truth is trampled under foot. Right is abolished. Might takes its place. Angels weep and hide their faces. 

#### *Under Two Captains: The Autobiography of Colonel John Jacob Lehmanowsky*. 155 pgs. [101b]

>Jewish believer in Jesus Christ and faithful Lutheran. Colonel in the army of Napoleon. Friend of Lafayette and the American statesman Henry Clay.  Immigrant to America.  Participant in the Westward migration.  

#### *Theodore Emanuel Schmauk A Biographical Sketch* by George W. Sandt. 290 pgs. 28 illus. [102b]

>There is no man in our Church whose Christian consecration has been more evident, whose deep loyalty to the Church has been stronger, whose full participation in her thought and activity has been wider, whose counsel has been more constantly sought and given, whose influence has been more powerful and helpful than that of Dr. Schmauk. –Dr. Knubel, *The Lutheran* 

#### *New Testament Conversions* by George Henry Gerberding. 163 pgs. [103d]

>Why, a book of sermons on conversion? Because not all that has been written and preached on the subject is truth. Much of it is the saddest and most dangerous caricature of truth. Few subjects have been more abused, misrepresented and misunderstood. A veritable flood of ruinous error has emanated from pen and pulpit on this subject. A sad wreckage of doubt, gloom, skepticism, despair, insanity and self-destruction is the result. Much of the current twaddle is the shallowest sentimentalism or the wildest fanaticism, with all the various baseless gradations be tween. It tends to confuse the mind, to harden the heart, to quench the spirit, to ruin the soul. -G H Gerberding, from the Introduction

#### *Infant Baptism and Infant Salvation in Calvinism* by Charles P. Krauth. 135 pgs. [110t]

>There are but two developed systems in the world that claim with any show of probability to be purely Biblical. These systems are the Lutheran and the Calvinistic. They possess a common basis in their recognition of the same rule of faith; their profession of the Old Catholic faith as set forth in the three General Creeds; in their acknowledgment of the doctrine of justification by faith and of its great associated doctrines; and they have vast interests, great stakes, mighty bonds of sympathy in common. No two bodies of Christians have more reason for thoroughly understanding each other than Calvinists and Lutherans have, and no two parts of Christendom are closer together in some vital respects than consistent Calvinism and consistent Lutheranism. It is well worth their while to compare views. – Charles Krauth from *Infant Baptism and Infant Salvation in Calvinism*

## Scheduled for Late 2017 – Early 2018 Release

#### *The Confessional Principle* by Theodore E. Schmauk [104t]

>...the Elector of Saxony received many letters of protest from Calvinistic princes and from Crypto-Calvinistic sources; and even Queen Elizabeth of England sent over a deputation in the interests of Calvinism not to allow this book <span class="inline">[The Lutheran Formula of Concord]</span> to be promulgated. Many Reformed proposed that a common Reformed Confession should be set up over against the Formula of Concord, and that the Reformed should withdraw from their acceptance of the Augsburg Confession; but Ursinus, the author of the Heidelberg Catechism, wrote to Beza to the effect that it would be better to continue to accept the Augsburg Confession (and to agitate against the Formula). - From Chapter 25.

#### *Life and Letters of W A Passavant* by George Henry Gerberding [105b]

>The Life of Dr. Passavant should have been given to the Church at least a decade ago. All good biography is history in the concrete. In the lives of God's eminent children we have most useful and delightful information for the mind, inspiration for the spirit, braces for our faith, stimuli for our hope and most effective incentives for our love. Such lives are lived for others. They are not over when those who lived them are gone, but being dead they yet speak. The stories of these saints are written for our inspiration, for our warning and for our comfort. If posterity is to have the benefit of such lives, their story must be written. It ought to be written while the memory of the heroes is still fresh and the heart still warm towards them. Few lives have been so eminently beautiful and attractive, so useful to others, so many-sided, so helpful to the Church and so signally owned of God as the life of Dr. Passavant. 

#### *Gotthold's Emblems* by Christian Scriber [106d]

>His works had entirely disappeared out of the booksellers' shops, when some stray copies of them, almost entirely decayed, and secretly valued by their owners as the legacy of pious ancestors, but generally despised, ridiculed, and rejected, fell into the hands of some Christian and judicious men, who were not deterred from reading and examining them, either by the dust which time had accumulated on their boards, or yet by the partially antiquated language of the contents. They instantly felt that the Spirit of God and of genuine Christianity, breathed out of the sallow pages, – and began to vie with each other, and with his admirers of a bygone age, in praising and applauding the author.
>
>"If any clergyman needs a spiritual guide, let him choose Scriver. He is the preacher for preachers, full of consolation and encouragement to the well-meaning, but a storm of hail to the faithless and slothful pastor."

#### *The Conservative Reformation and Its Theology* by Charles P. Krauth [107t]

>This monumental work, first published in 1871, is regarded as one of the great theological classics to come out of American Lutheranism... Dr Krauth's treatment of the basic doctrines of the Lutheran church is exegetical, dogmatical, and confessional, and reveals a profound understanding of the teachings of Luther and the Reformation. –From the reprint edition.

#### *Summary of the Christian Faith* by Henry Eyster Jacobs [109t]

>An attempt is here made to restate the doctrines of the Christian Faith upon the basis of the Lutheran Confessions.
>
>To the Candidates for the Ministry of the Gospel, among whom my life has been passed, this volume is affectionately dedicated by their fellow-student, H. E. J
 
#### *Discourses on Romanism and the Reformation* by Emanuel Greenwald [112h]

>The occasion which led to the preparation and delivery of these Discourses, was the advent of a Jesuit Missionary, and the holding of a Jesuit "Mission" in Lancaster in the month of September 1879, at which the doctrines and character of Luther and the Reformation were severely criticized. The "Mission" was conducted with unusual eloquence and skill. It awakened a considerable spirit of inquiry in the community. Large audiences, even of Protestants, thronged to hear, and a few were misled by the ingenious arguments employed, to adopt the sentiments advocated. It seemed that the attack upon the Lutheran Reformation, Protestant doctrines, and the Protestant Churches, should not be permitted to pass unnoticed. A course of Sunday Evening Sermons was, therefore, inaugurated, and for seven Sundays, beginning October 5th, the large Church of the Holy Trinity was crowded each evening with a most attentive and deeply interested audience. The Vestry of the Church, as well as many others, have earnestly advised the publication of the Sermons. They are, therefore, submitted to the public in the hope that they may serve to promote in some degree, the cause of Evangelical truth, and with the fervent prayer that the blessing of our dear Lord Jesus Christ may accompany them.

#### *A Colony of Mercy* by Julie Sutter [113h]

>And every one in distress, and every one in debt, and every one discontented, gathered themselves unto him, and he became a captain over them.
