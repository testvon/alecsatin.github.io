It's common to be worried.  Lots of people are up in the night with anxiety about what the next day will bring.  But not many have had anticipatory suffering so great as to cause the condition of hematohidrosis, or sweating blood.  Yes, this is a real physical phenomenon reported in medical and historical records.  The most well-known person to have experienced this is Jesus Christ.

_And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. (Luke 22:44)_



# What is hematohidrosis and how does it occur?





Literally hematohidrosis means "blood-sweating".  The most common causes include fear and intense mental contemplation.[^4947330a]  The picture at the top of this post shows a healthy 12 year old girl with no bleeding disorders or other physical problems, _sweating blood_.

# Did Jesus really sweat drops of blood in the Garden of Gethsemane?





Since we know that the Bible is true in all details, and since the physician-apostle Luke described the specific historical event of Jesus's sweating drops of blood, and finally, since hematohidrosis is a rare, but real physical phenomenon, you can be certain that Jesus did in fact sweat drops of blood.



# Prayer



Dear Lord, we know that you have been tempted in every way that we are, yet without sin.  Thank you for taking upon yourself the suffering which we deserve.  Willingly, you obey your Father.  May we obey you.  In your precious name we pray, Amen.
