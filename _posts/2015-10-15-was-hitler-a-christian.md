_The heaviest blow that ever struck humanity was the coming of Christianity_ -Adolf Hitler

There continues to be low-level attempt to recreate history by making Adolf Hitler a Christian.  No matter how many times or in how many different ways these statements are repeated, they will never be true.  The linked video above completely refutes the idea that Adolf Hitler was in any way, shape, or form a Biblical Christian.









## The Christian church under German fascism



An article [published by the BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1753469.stm) includes this statement:



<blockquote>
  "A lot of people will say, 'I didn't realize that they (German fascists) were trying to convert Christians to a Nazi philosophy', Ms Mandel, a third year law student, told Philadelphia's The Inquirer newspaper.  "They wanted to eliminate Jews altogether, but they were also looking to eliminate Christianity."
</blockquote>



The BBC article refers to OSS documents used in preparation for the Nuremberg War Crimes trials and now released.  Here’s a section from a confidential paper entitled _Annex 4: The Persecution of the Christian churches_:[^b1c7f332]

[^b1c7f332]: Taken from _The Nazi Master Plan_, transcribed and annotated by Professor Richard Bonney, subtitled: Confidential, Approved By The Prosecution Review Board, Office Of Strategic Services, Research and Analysis Branch R & A No. 3114.4., DRAFT FOR WAR CRIMES STAFF,  6 July 1945.  [Source document](http://web.archive.org/web/20150930200658/http://www.leics.gov.uk/the_nazi_master_plan.pdf).



<blockquote>
  I. The Nature Of The Persecution
  
  Throughout  the  period  of  National  Socialist  rule,  religious  liberties  in Germany  and  in  the  occupied  areas  were  seriously  impaired.  The various  Christian  Churches  were  systematically  cut  off  from  effective communication with the people. They were confined as far as possible to  the  performance  of  narrowly  religious  functions,  and  even  within this narrow sphere were subjected to as many hindrances as the Nazis dared to impose. These results were accomplished partly by legal and partly by illegal and terroristic means.
</blockquote>



In other words, Christian churches were increasingly limited to “worship only” and not permitted to exert influence on other areas of social life.



<blockquote>
  III. The  Basic  National  Socialist  Attitude  Toward The Christian Churches
  
  National Socialism by its very nature was hostile to Christianity and the Christian  churches.  The  purpose  of  the  National  Socialist  movement was  to  convert  the German  people  into  a  homogeneous  racial  group united  in  all  its  energies  for [the] prosecution  of  aggressive  warfare...
  
  Although  the  principal  Christian  Churches  of  Germany  had  long  been associated  with  conservative  ways  of  thought,  which  meant  that  they tended  to  agree  with  the  National  Socialists  in  their  authoritarianism, in  their  attacks  on  Socialism  and  Communism...their doctrinal commitments could not be reconciled  with  the  principle  of  racism,  with  a  foreign  policy  of unlimited  aggressive  warfare,  or  with  a  domestic  policy  involving  the complete subservience of Church to State. Since these are fundamental elements of the National Socialist program, conflict was inevitable.
</blockquote>



The Nazi version of fascism was focused on military aggression as would be expected with their worship of the false god Odin.  German Christians were seduced at first through their hatred of socialism and communism. Sound familiar yet?



<blockquote>
  Important  leaders  of  the  National  Socialist  party  would  have  liked  to meet  this  situation  by  a  complete  extirpation  of  Christianity  and  the substitution  of  a  purely  racial  religion  tailored  to  fit  the  needs  of National  Socialist  policy.  [Source document](http://web.archive.org/web/20150930200658/http://www.leics.gov.uk/the_nazi_master_plan.pdf).
</blockquote>



Since the Nazi fascists wanted to avoid the possibility of a backlash, they adopted a steady, methodical process to bring the churches in line with fascist religious ideas.



# Recognizing faces



Hitler was a supremely religious man.  He was a pagan Theosophist aligned with the Thule Society and a worshipper of the fascist god Odin (Thor).  The underlying religious ideas of the German Nazi party were very much in line with those of the New Age and ecumenical movements in the present day United States.  The idea that all gods are the same, or that Allah is the same as the Christian God are intentional deceptions.

The one true God has shown us a different face.  He took human form and came to earth as Jesus Christ.  True Christians look to Him through His Word, the Bible for our salvation, instruction and inspiration.



# In our time



Perhaps what is happening to Christians and Christian churches in twenty-first century America is not connected to fascism.  Nevertheless, it's looking awfully similar to what has happened before.

If you are a Christian, it behooves you to understand the fascist mind.  Just as the German fascists worked for years secretly, deceptively and successfully to convert the thinking of German Christians along fascist lines, so American Christians are sounding more and more like fascists every day.  Worldliness doesn't just mean buying a lot of things.  The deeper meaning is _thinking like the enemies of God_.



<blockquote>
  And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. -Romans 12.2
  
  The mouth of a righteous [man is] a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. -Proverbs 10.11
</blockquote>



_Guard your heart and your mind.  The enemies of Christ are working on you._
