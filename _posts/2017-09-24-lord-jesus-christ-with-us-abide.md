> And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.
But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.
Luke 24:28-29

It's recommended you follow the lyrics below and listen - rather than watch - the video of this Reformation hymn.  The photographer's camera angle is a little odd.  But the singing is heartfelt, and the words as valid now as they were five centuries ago.

Lord Jesus Christ, with us abide, today and always.  Amen.

## Lyrics *Lord Jesus Christ, With Us Abide*

## by Nikolaus Selnecker, 1532-1592

|  1. Lord Jesus Christ, with us abide,
|  For round us falls the eventide;
|  Nor let Thy Word, that heavenly light,
|  For us be ever veiled in night.
|  
|  2. In these last days of sore distress
|  Grant us, dear Lord, true steadfastness
|  That pure we keep, till life is spent,
|  Thy holy Word and Sacrament.
|  
|  3. Lord Jesus, help, Thy Church uphold,
|  For we are sluggish, thoughtless, cold.
|  Oh, prosper well Thy Word of grace
|  And spread its truth in every place!
|  
|  4. Oh, keep us in Thy Word, we pray;
|  The guile and rage of Satan stay!
|  Oh, may Thy mercy never cease!
|  Give concord, patience, courage, peace.
|  
|  5. O God, how sin's dread works abound!
|  Throughout the earth no rest is found,
|  And falsehood's spirit wide has spread,
|  And error boldly rears its head.
|  
|  6. The haughty spirits, Lord, restrain
|  Who o'er Thy Church with might would reign
|  And always set forth something new,
|  Devised to change Thy doctrine true.
|  
|  7. And since the cause and glory, Lord,
|  Are Thine, not ours, to us afford
|  Thy help and strength and constancy.
|  With all our heart we trust in Thee.
|  
|  8. A trusty weapon is Thy Word,
|  Thy Church's buckler, shield and sword.
|  Oh, let us in its power confide
|  That we may seek no other guide!
|  
|  9. Oh, grant that in Thy holy Word
|  We here may live and die, dear Lord;
|  And when our journey endeth here,
|  Receive us into glory there.
