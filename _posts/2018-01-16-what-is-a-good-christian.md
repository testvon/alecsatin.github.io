_Question No. 3._ What does it take to constitute a good Christian? 

_Answer:_ That is a very good question. I hardly know how to answer that in a few words, but I would say, to make my answer short, Study the ten commandments until you find out your sins; then flee to Christ and ask His forgiveness. Put your trust in the true and living God, having faith in Him; pray daily; expect an answer to your prayers because you pray in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Remember His covenant every day that you should rise in newness of life as Jesus rose from the grave. Go to the Lord's Supper every time you can. Remember, it is the sweetest communion on earth. Never miss Divine service unless you are too sick to come. Whatever you learn of God, live it, and whatever you do, do it to the glory of God. Be faithful until death, and receive the crown of eternal life.
