Lemurs are a type of primate found on Madagascar, an island about 250 miles off the southeastern coast of Africa.  The smallest lemurs can fit into the palm of your hand, and weigh about an ounce. Lemurs are extremely social, as you can see in the one-minute video.

In the video you can see why having a lemur as a pet is probably not a good idea.

# Prayer

Dear Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth. The heavens and earth declare your glory.  Thank you that everything you do is exceedingly good.  Thank you for the lemur, and for all your wonderful creatures.  Through Jesus' name by whom all things were made that were made, _Amen_.
