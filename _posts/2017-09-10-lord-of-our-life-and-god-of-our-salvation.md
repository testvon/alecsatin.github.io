## Lyrics

|  1. Lord of our life and God of our salvation.
|  Star of our night and Hope of every nation,
|  Hear and receive Thy Church's supplication,
|  Lord God Almighty.
|  
|  2. See round Thine ark the hungry billows curling;
|  See how thy foes their banners are unfurling.
|  Lord, while their darts envenomed they are hurling,
|  Thou canst preserve us.
|  
|  3. Lord, Thou canst help when earthly armor faileth;
|  Lord, Thou canst save when deadly sin assaileth;
|  Lord, o'er Thy Church nor death nor hell prevaileth;
|  Grant us Thy peace, Lord:
|  
|  4. Peace in our hearts, our evil thoughts assuaging;
|  Peace in Thy Church where brothers are engaging;
|  Peace when the world its busy war is waging.
|  Calm Thy foes' raging.
|  
|  5. Grant us Thy help till backward they are driven;
|  Grant them Thy truth that they may be forgiven;
|  Grant peace on earth or, after we have striven,
|  Peace in Thy heaven.
